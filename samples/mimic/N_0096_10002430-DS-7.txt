Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Consider discontinuing amiodarone given persistence of AF 
despite this medication
[] Consider starting beta blocker, if BP is able to tolerate. 
Patient previously did not tolerate this medication while on 
pembrolizumab (dizziness and ___, but patient has been off of 
pembrolizumab since ___
[] Consider starting spironolactone and ___ pending blood 
pressures; trialed losartan and spironolactone during this 
admission, but ultimately held due to hypotension. 
[] His LFTs should be rechecked ~2 weeks after discharge 
(___). He has a history of transaminitis attributed in part 
to statin use in the past; he was restarted on rosuvastatin this 
admission (given history of CAD s/p CABG), and LFTs on day of 
admission were ALT 38, AST 46, Alk phos 108, Tbili 0.5.
[] Follow up with Oncology regarding melanoma.
[] Monitor for resolution of supplemental O2 requirement after 
discharge. He was requiring ___ of O2 by NC at time of 
discharge, in the setting of recovering from pneumonia.

DISCHARGE WT: 116.18 lbs
DISCHARTE Cr: 2.0
DISCHARGE DIURETIC: torsemide 60 mg PO BID

SUMMARY:
===============
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with PMH of HFrEF (35% 
___,
CAD s/p 3v CABG (___) and subsequent PCI to the LAD (___),
moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction,
moderate pulmonary hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation on apixaban, stage III chronic kidney disease 
(Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1), cerebrovascular disease, and metastatic 
melanoma of unknown primary on Pembrolizumab (on hold since 
___ iso worsening transaminitis and concern for 
cardiotoxicity). He was admitted with volume overload from heart 
failure exacerbation and pneumonia with high oxygen 
requirements. He initially required CCU admission for high flow 
oxygen, weaned to nasal cannula after aggressive IV diuresis and 
treatment of pneumonia with 5 day course of Zosyn after 
receiving vancomycin at OSH. He was transferred to cardiology 
floor where he continued to diurese well and his oxygen 
requirement was weaned to ___. He was transitioned to 60 mg 
torsemide PO BID which adequately maintained euvolemia. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation
Patient with history of heart failure with etiology likely 
ischemic cardiomyopathy given history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI. 
Admitted with fluid overload and pleural effusion. Trigger for 
current exacerbation could be infectious given evidence of 
pneumonia in left lower lobe on admission. Patient with high 
oxygen requirements prior to admission but responded 
appropriately to diuresis with Lasix. After IV diuresis, patient 
was transitioned PO torsemide and maintained at euvolemia. With 
effective diuresis, the patient's oxygen requirement gradually 
lowered from 4L NC to ___ NC. He was discharged on torsemide 60 
mg PO BID. He was unable to tolerate afterload reducing agents 
or neurohormonal blockade agents due to hypotension. 

# Lower left lobe pneumonia
Patient with evidence of pneumonia in the left lower lobe, 
received vanc/zosyn at outside hospital and continued on Zosyn 
here for a total of 5 day course with resolution of symptoms. We 
suspect that his lingering O2 requirement is at least in part 
due to slowly resorbing consolidation left over from his 
infection. He was requiring ___ of supplemental O2 by NC at 
time of discharge.

# Pleural effusion, bilateral
Patient with evidence of right pleural effusion. Etiology likely 
fluid overload given heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction. Pleural effusion resolved improved with diuresis and 
his oxygen requirement trended down to ___ NC. Given this, 
thoracentesis was deferred. 

# Atrial fibrillation
Patient with chronic history of atrial fibrillation. In afib 
throughout this admission. Continued amiodarone and apixaban. 
Rates appropriately controlled.

CHRONIC ISSUES
================
# Coronary artery disease s/p CABG
Patient with history of 3 vessel CABG on ___ (___) and
subsequent PCI to LAD (___). Continued home aspirin. Patient 
was started on low dose rosuvastatin 5 mg daily. On review, it 
appears he had been on this medication at this dose in the past 
but it was discontinued due to transamnitis; however, at the 
time it was unclear whether this was an effect of the statin or 
pembrolizumab. Given that the patient has not had his checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy since ___, the decision was to restart 
rosuvastatin. 

# Chronic kidney disease
Baseline Cr appears to be 2.1-2.2 over past year. Cr remained 
between 1.8-2.4 throughout admission. 

# Anemia
Chronic, although worsening since ___. On admission 
hemoglobin
10.6 and remained stable. 

# Thrombocytopenia
Uncertain etiology, appears subacute/chronic. On admission
platelets 130 down-trended to 100s. No concern for bleeding 
throughout admission. 

# Melanoma
Patient with history of metastatic melanoma with unknown 
primary.
On treatment with pembrolizumab, but held since ___ iso
toxicity.

out. You improved considerably and are ready to leave the 
hospital.  

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
