CXR ___: 1. Mild congestive heart failure.  
2. Widened superior mediastinum with leftward deviation of the 
trachea, similar when compared to the prior study. Findings may 
reflect the presence of a thyroid goiter, and clinical 
correlation is recommended, and if indicated, this could be 
confirmed with a CT of the chest.  
  
L-spine film ___: Five non-rib-bearing lumbar-type vertebral 
 
bodies are present. There are multilevel degenerative changes, 
with loss of intervertebral disc height at multiple levels, 
endplate sclerotic changes, and anterior osteophyte formation. 
There is no fracture or vertebral compression deformity 
identified. There is likely mild grade 1 L5 on S1 
anterolisthesis, which is likely degenerative in etiology. Facet 
hypertrophic changes are noted within the lower lumbar spine 
primarily affecting L3 through L5 levels. Vascular 
calcifications are visualized. The sacroiliac joints are not 
diastatic.  
IMPRESSION: No fracture identified.  

CT head ___:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or acute 
vascular 
territorial infarction. Note is made of areas of 
encephalomalacia involving the parietal lobe on the left, which 
appear unchanged as does an area of hypodensity on the right 
adjacent to the caudat.. Similarly unchanged are two left 
frontal meningiomas, the larger of which is partially calcified, 
and better depicted on the prior MRI (2:24, 601:19). Ventricles 
and sulci are enlarged, reflecting parenchymal volume loss. Note 
is made of atherosclerotic calcification at the carotid siphons 
bilaterally as well as of both V4 segments. There is no 
fracture. The mastoid air cells are clear. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality, and unchanged 
findings of 
previous infarcts and meningiomas. 

LENIs ___:
Waveforms in the common femoral veins are symmetric bilaterally 
with appropriate responses to Valsalva maneuvers. In both lower 
extremities, the common femoral, proximal greater saphenous, 
superficial femoral and popliteal veins are normal with 
appropriate compressibility, wall-to-wall flow on color Doppler 
analysis and response to waveform augmentation. Wall-to-wall 
flow is also visualized in the posterior tibial and peroneal 
veins of both calves.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity. 

  

MICROBIOLOGY: 
___: Blood culture - no growth to date

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with DM, afib, and CHF presenting with pulm edema and 
worsening ___ edema.
 
# CHF: Likely an acute on chronic worsening of diastolic 
congestive heart failure (most recent LVEF >55%) and recent 
decrease in mobility from fall. Ruled out for MI. Likely his 
worsening edema is due to medication non-compliance versus 
worsening of his aortic stenosis. His most recent echo is from 
___, and it was recommended this be repeated as an outpatient. 
He was never hypoxic, though lung exam suggested increased pulm 
edema. His legs were elevated and compression stockings were 
used. His torsemide was dosed at 10mg daily, though it's unclear 
if this was an increase from 5mg or the same dose, and the 
patient and wife were unable to clarify. There was slight 
improvement in swelling on discharge.
 
# RECENT FALLS: Patient reports falling twice recently at home 
and on a trip. He was evaluated by physical therapy, who felt he 
is unsteady on his feet but safe for discharge home with ___ and 
a walker/commode. The wife was instructed to maintain 24 hour 
care for him in the home to help prevent further falls. 

# ___: Cr up to 1.6 on admission. Improved to 1.3 the next day, 
likely closer to baseline. 
   
# DM: Glipizide and actos held while in hospital. Covered with 
an insulin sliding scale and oral medications restarted on 
discharge.
  
# HTN: Continued isosorbide and lisinopril (held for one day 
given ___. Metoprolol dose was lowered to 25mg TID given his 
bradycardia.

# Afib: INR was 2.9 on admission, and unclear if he had taken 
his daily coumadin dose. He was restarted at 2.5mg daily. His 
wife noted that he had been switched to alternate 1.25mg with 
2.5mg. He was discharged with home services to follow INRs.

date.
