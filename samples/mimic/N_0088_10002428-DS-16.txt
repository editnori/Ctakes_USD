Imaging:
CT Abd/Plevis with Contrast (___):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse colonic mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel wall 
thickening is
consistent with pancolitis.
2.  Ground-glass opacities within the right middle and right 
lower lobes
compatible with acute infection and/or aspiration.  Possible 
mild pulmonary
edema.
3.  Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and prominence of the 
common bile and pancreatic ducts could be better characterized 
with non-emergent MRCP.

CXR (___):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bibasilar opacities would be consistent with pneumonia 
and/or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  Likely some 
component of pulmonary edema given the interstitial thickening.
2.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel may represent ileus or 
obstruction. Dedicated abdominal radiograph may be performed for 
better characterization.

ECHO (___):
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild 
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular 
calcification. There is moderate functional mitral stenosis 
(mean gradient XXmmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild 
to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
mitral regurgitation is now less prominent. The mitral inflow 
gradient is similar (although not reported in the previous 
report). 

AXR (___):
There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.  There are multiple 
distended loops of bowel, most likely representing both colon 
and small bowel.  Findings are most consistent with an ileus.  
Air-fluid levels are seen on the left lateral decubitus view.
IMPRESSION:  Dilated colon and small bowel consistent with 
ileus.

Head CT (___): IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

ECHO (___):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is 
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. There is mild aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area 1.6 cm2). Due to the technically suboptimal nature 
of this study, LVOT obstruction cannot be excluded with 
certainty. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There 
is severe mitral annular calcification (cannot exclude posterior 
leaflet MVP). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due 
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may 
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

Repeat CT Abd/Pelvis (___):
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, 
and in 
abdominal ascites.  The colon remains dilated and ahaustral, in 
keeping with C. difficile colitis. 

CXR (___):
There is a Dobbhoff tube whose distal tip is in the body of the 
stomach.  
There are bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a right-sided 
pleural-based catheter.  There is no pneumothoraces or signs for 
overt pulmonary edema.  Overall, these findings are stable since 
prior study from ___. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an ___ year-old woman with history of Sjogren's syndrome 
and IBS presenting with fevers, diarrhea, tachycardia, 
hypotension, leukocytosis, hypoxia, found to have pancolitis and 
pneumonia.

# Septic Shock due to Cdiff Colitis: On admission meet criteria 
for sepsis given fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis and likely 
source being colitis. BP remained low and patient remained 
mildly tachycardic for next ___ requiring aggressive IVF 
(roughly 20L in first 72hrs). Initially started on IV flagyl/PO 
vanco emperically for possible Cdiff as well as levofloxacin 
over concern for PNA. Bcx, Ucx unrevealing. Stool for Cdiff 
ultimately positive and levofloxacin changed to CTX/Azithro. PCP 
(Dr. ___ visited and said that pt always has CXR infiltrate 
so abx for CTX/Azithro for pneumonia stopped after pt had 
received total of 3 days PNA treatment. Lactate and WBC count 
trended up in first 48hrs and patient developed ileus on 
abdominal imaging with worsening distension. GI and Gen Surg 
followed and pt kept NPO initially, but ultimately illness 
turned around with just Abx and IVF. By time of ICU call-out, BP 
had stabilized without requiring fluids and abdominal exam was 
improving with downtrending WBC. Came back to ICU on ___ due to 
respiratory distress and hypoxia. Also had to be started back on 
pressors, initially phenylephrine but then this was stopped as 
extremities were cold and mottled. Pressors changed to 
Norepinephrine and mottling of ext quickly resolved. SVO2 and 
ECHO not consistent with cardiogenic shock and EKG/Trops were 
negative. ID saw in consult and recommended starting Tigecycline 
to help cover Cdiff which she completed an 8 day course of. 
Abdominal exam improved and ileus resolved. Doboff was placed on 
___ and tube feeds were started due poor ability to keep with 
with nutritional requirements. Metronidazole d/c'd on ___. Plan 
to continue Vancomycin 500mg PO Q6 for a total of 2 weeks after 
all other antibiotics were stopped (last day ___.

# Hypoxia: No breathing issues at baseline but developed hypoxia 
requiring 5L NC while in ED so was admitted to the ICU. Initial 
concern for RLL PNA on CXR and received 3 days of Abx as noted 
above until PCP informed MICU team that infiltrate had been 
present for some time. Thought that hypoxia developed in setting 
of aggressive fluids in patient with significant mitral regurg 
(got 4L in ED and then aggressive IVF in first 72hrs) and the 
development of pleural effusions. Had started diuresis by MICU 
callout on ___ but then after couple days on floor, triggered 
for hypoxia and increased work of breathing on ___. Found to 
have significant worsening of R pleural effusion and development 
of L pleural effusion. Required intubation for respiratory state 
on ___. Cardiac w/u showed no cardiogenic component and when 
spiked fever on ___ started on empiric HCAP coverage after 
mini-BAL was performed. Interventional pulmonary (IP) consulted 
on ___ and performed right sided thoracentesis with pigtail 
placement. ID saw on ___ and recommended stopping 
Vanco/cefepime as unclear if actual pneumonia and starting 
Tigecycline as would cover many HCAP organisms and also treat 
Cdiff. Mini-BAL and pleural fluid with negative cultures. 
Started diuresis again on ___ as she was weaned off pressors 
and extubated. She was weaned off all oxygen at the time of 
discharge and right pigtail still draining 400-700cc per day, 
will follow-up with IP after discharge.  She will require 
ongoing diuresis given her significant volume overload, she 
responds well to ___ IV Lasix and had been ___ negative 
in the days leading up to discharge.

# Altered Mental Status: 
In setting of trigger for hypoxia and MICU transfer on ___, 
there was concern that she was less responsive with concern for 
focal defecits. Stat head CT without evidence of stroke or 
bleed. Neuro was consulted and said nothing to do and deficits 
resolved over next ___. EEG initially ordered but then 
canceled after discussion with neuro. Rest of ICU stay had 
intermittent delerium in the evenings requiring some doses of 
Olanzapine. Delerium had improved by time of ICU callout but 
still with some sundowning.

# Hyponatremia: Patient with Na of 127 in ED. Likely hypovolemic 
hyponatremia in setting of diarrhea/poor PO intake. Could also 
be SIADH given pneumonia, pain. Upon review of old labs, patient 
often hyponatremic as outpatient as well. Urine lytes confusing 
in setting of shock as urine Na elevated in ___ so some question 
of sodium wasting renal injury. Hyponatremia started to resolve 
as overall condition improved and did not re-develop even in 
setting of ___ ICU readmission for hypoxia.

# ___: Patient with creatinine of 1.1 at admission up from 
recent baseline of 0.7 - 0.8. Likely pre-renal etiology in 
setting of infection, diarrhea, poor PO intake. Trended up 
slightly to 1.3 after a few days likely with mild ATN in setting 
of persistent boarderline hypotension. Lisinopril was held while 
in ICU for this and hypotension. Cr trended back down to roughly 
0.5 and stayed there for rest of hospitalization even in setting 
of second ICU readmission.

--Inactive issues--

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

# Hypertension: Due to hypotension with sepsis, lisinopril was 
held.  BP remained well controlled and this will continue to be 
held at discharge.

# GERD: Omeprazole stopped when Cdiff came back positive. For 
time was put on H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis but this stopped 
again when delerious and started feeeding.

# Code: Full (confirmed with patient, son-in-law)

# Transitional issues
-Right pigtail pleural catheter in place at discharge, she will 
follow-up with interventional pulmonary after discharge. Tube 
can be removed when output is <200cc per day.
-Will need ongoing diuresis given large volume of fluids she 
received in the ICU this admission, she responds well to Lasix 
10mg IV. Goal ___ negative as BP tolerates.
-Will continue on high dose PO vancomycin through ___ (___fter other abx stopped)
-She should continue tube feeds until taking adequate PO, would 
benefit from ongoing nutrition evaluation
