Flexible Sigmoidoscopy - ___
Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the rectum and sigmoid colon. 
 
Other No bleeding sources or blood identified, though extent of 
sigmoid colon evaluated was limited by poor prep.  
Impression: Normal mucosa in the rectum and sigmoid colon
No bleeding sources or blood identified, though extent of 
sigmoid colon evaluated was limited by poor prep.
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to sigmoid colon at 25 cm 
Recommendations: If bleeding recurs, would recommend full 
colonoscopy with prep. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old female with past medical history of 
sjogrens, hemorrhoids, prior cdiff infection, admitted ___ 
with bright red blood per rectum thought to be acute lower GI 
bleed, subsequently stabilizing without intervention, status 
post flexible sigmoidoscopy without identifiable source, 
remaining stable x greater than 4 days, able to be discharged to 
rehab facility.

# Acute GI Bleed NOS - Patient presented with acute episode of 
BRBPR concerning for lower GI source.  Patient subsequently 
monitored without new or worsening anemia.  After discussion 
with family and patient regarding whether or not to further 
workup, they opted for flexible sigmoidoscopy (felt colonoscopy 
might be too invasive).  Patient underwent aborted flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on ___ due to pressence of copious stool in 
rectal vault, and then underwent successful flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on ___ without identifiable source for her 
bleeding.  From admission Hgb 9.8, discharge hemoglobin was 
10.5.  Per GI, could consider outpatient colonoscopy if 
consistent with patient's wishes.  

# Osteoporosis / chronic L1 compression fracture / 
deconditioning - patient with recent L1 compression fracture as 
outpatient prior to admission; patient noted to be significantly 
deconditioned this admission, requiring assistance with ADLs; 
patient seen by ___ and recommended for rehab.  Continued home 
Calcium 500 + vitamin D, calcitonin.  Placed on Tylenol and 
tramadol for pain control with good effect 

# Chronic Severe Protein Calorie Malnutrition - per discussion 
with family and review of chart, patient has lost weight despite 
PEG placement and bolus tube feeds (has had difficulty 
maintaining PO intake due to her Sjogrens).  At home patient has 
not be using full recommended 2 cans of Nutren 2.0, 500 
Cal/250ml BID.  Here patient seen by nutrition, continued on 
above 2 cans, and was given oral supplementation with her PO 
meals as well.   

# Depression - continued home BuPROPion and mirtazapine 

# Hypothryoidism - continued levothyroxine 

Transitional Issues
- Code status - DNR/DNI
- Discharged to rehab
- No source for bleeding identified this admission; can consider 
future colonoscopy to look for source of bleeding, but would 
first discuss if consistent with patient's goals of care
- Would consider encouragement of PO intake and PEG-tube 
supplementation given her malnutrition
