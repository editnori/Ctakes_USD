EXAMINATION:  CTA CHEST WITH CONTRAST  
COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
HEART AND VASCULATURE: There is no central pulmonary embolism.  
The thoracic 
aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of dissection or 
intramural 
hematoma.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within 
normal limits. 
No pericardial effusion is seen. 
  
AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: There is a 8.8 x 5.8 x 9.8 cm 
collection in the 
left breast, with density measuring 39 Hounsfield units, 
consistent with 
hematoma.  There are few foci of air within the collection, 
likely from prior 
aspiration, as well as few punctate hyperdensities at the 
periphery.  No 
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is present.  The 
right axilla 
is not included on the study.  No mediastinal mass. 
  
PLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  
LUNGS/AIRWAYS: Partially visualized lungs are clear without 
masses or areas of 
parenchymal opacification.  The airways are patent to the level 
of the 
segmental bronchi bilaterally. 
  
BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show 
no abnormality. 
  
BONES: No suspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? There is no 
acute fracture. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
8.8 x 5.8 x 9.8 cm left breast hematoma, with no evidence of 
active bleed.  
Please note, timing was suboptimal as the patient needed to be 
re-scanned due 
to incomplete field-of-view on initial images, however, the 
density of the 
collection was unchanged on all series.
