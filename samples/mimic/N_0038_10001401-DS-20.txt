   FLUID CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. 
   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH. 

PERTINENT IMAGING:
==================
CT ABD&PEL W/ CONTRAST 
___
1. Interval decrease in size of the right hemipelvis fluid 
collection (7.0 x 6.5 x 11.3 cm, previously 10.0 x 12.7 x 14.8 
cm) with the anterior approach pigtail catheter unchanged in 
position.  The pigtail is again located partly within the 
collection and partly outside its wall. 
2. Interval increase in size of the left pelvic fluid 
collection, now 
measuring 14.7 x 16.2 x 23.3 cm (previously 13.6 x 13.9 x 23.0 
cm). Increased peripheral enhancement may suggest superimposed 
infection. 
3. No new fluid collection identified. 
  
CTA ABD & PELVIS
___
1. Decrease in size of right lower quadrant fluid collection 
that has 
percutaneous drain within it, with areas of high attenuation on 
noncontrast exam consistent with blood products, and associated 
hyperemia which is likely inflammatory, but without evidence of 
contrast extravasation. 
2. There is large stable fluid collection in the low left 
abdomen, pelvis with mild linear peripheral enhancement, 
infection cannot be excluded. 
3. There is severe left, and moderate to severe right 
hydroureteronephrosis, with delayed left nephrogram, stable from 
today.  Mass effect about anastomosis between distal ureters and 
neobladder has resolved all since ___, and while 
hydronephrosis may be from residual edema, if this does not 
resolve, alternative etiologies including stenosis, tumor 
infiltration should be excluded. 
4. Tiny hepatic lesion segment ___, attention to this area on 
subsequent 
followups recommended. 

CT INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE
___ 
1.  Complete collapse the patient has recently drained left 
lower quadrant 
collection.  The catheter from this collection was removed. 
2.  Near complete collapse of the patient is originally drained 
collection in the mid pelvis, with pigtail catheter in place. 
3.  Left lower quadrant and deep pelvic collections as above.  
These findings were discussed with the team.  Given the 
patient's improving clinical status, the decision was made to 
pursue no further collection drainage at this time. 
4.  Severe bilateral hydronephrosis, as on prior examinations. 
RECOMMENDATION:  Given persistence of severe hydronephrosis, 
percutaneous 
nephrostomy tubes should be considered. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
==============
___ year old women with a history of bladder cancer s/p 
cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, whose 
post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, ileus, and 
pelvic fluid collections w/ one LLQ drain presented with 
subjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output. She was 
found to have worsening anemia and was given 2 units of pRBC 
with appropriate increase in hemoglobin noted. She was also 
found on CT imaging to have an interval increase in size of a 
left abdominal fluid collection. Decision was made to place a 
drain per ID. Fluid was sent and revealed: negative cultures, 
negative malignant cells, no evidence of lymphatic or urinary 
fluid. This new drain was subsequently removed per ___ as fluid 
collection was completely drained. The prior drain was still 
draining serosanguinous fluid and was kept in but repositioned. 
ID was consulted for the fevers, leukocytosis and fluid 
collections and was deemed to need antibiotics and tranisitioned 
from broad spectrum to IV ertapenem at discharge. Will require 
multiple follow ups and imaging as specified in the transitional 
issues. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Pelvic fluid collections: patient arrived with one anterior 
drain putting out serosanguinous fluid. CT abdomen/pelvis 
revealed enlarging left fluid collection, and decision was made 
to place a drain per ___. The fluid was negative for malignant 
cells. The fluid had Cr 1 and triglycerides <9 suggesting that 
fluid collection is neither urine nor lymphatic fluid. Fluid 
culture was negative for bacteria. On interval imaging, the new 
enlarging fluid collection had completely collapsed and the 
drain was removed. As for the other fluid collection that 
already had a drain putting out serosanguinous fluid, it 
continued to drain serosanguinous fluid but at a lower rate than 
prior to admission. The drain was left in place as the fluid 
collection on imaging had not completely collapsed. BID - N 
cultures for the aforementioned fluid collection came back 
positive for MSSA but per ID, does not reflect rue 
intra-abdominal infection. Given that patient had a fever at OSH 
and a leukocytosis, she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics 
with vanc, ceftaz and flagyl. This was tapered per ID team to IV 
zosyn. On discharge, ID recommended ertapenem for approximately 
4 weeks with final length of treatment to be determined by fluid 
collection changes on repeat imaging on outpatient basis. Mrs. 
___ remained afebrile, and leukocytosis resolved. 

#Pulmonary embolism: Likely developed in the setting of being 
diagnosed with a post-op DVT. She was placed on lovenox.  She 
was transitioned to heparin ggt as she needed ___ procedures and 
was transitioned back to lovenox but at a lower dose per weight 
dosing to 70mg q12H upon discharge. 

#Acute renal injury: SCr has been steadily rising from a 
baseline of around 0.04-0.06 in ___ to 1.1, likely 
___ obstructed uropathy ___ large pelbic fluid collections. ___ 
resolved over the course of her hospital stay with final Cr 0.8. 


#Hydronephrosis: bilateral and worsening on interval imaging 
from prior studies. Given patient's age, adequate urinary 
output, adequate creatinine clearance, and no significant 
electrolyte abnormalities, patient likely would not 
significantly benefit from intervention at this time. Per 
urology consult, deemed stable for discharge and recommended 
outpatient urology followup. 

#Anemia: likely a combination of anemia of chronic inflammation 
and acute blood loss ___ to anterior abdominal drain showing 
serosanguinous fluid. Labs not consistent with hemolysis. 
Received 2 units of pRBC with appropriate response. Patient was 
discharged with Hgb of 8.3 per hem/onc recommendation for 
threshold Hgb>8 as patient feels and functionally performs 
better with higher blood counts. 

#Hypokalemia: was hypokalemic and was repleted with oral KCl 
PRN. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma, involving the deep 
muscularis propria
S/p cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, 
whose post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, 
ileus, and pelvic fluid collections.  Patient stating that there 
is no plan for chemo and radiation, her PET scan does show 
concerning foci of metastatic disease in the lung and 
peritoneum. Per patient's son, Mrs. ___ has seen a doctor 
to work up the lung mass. Will need ongoing discussion with 
outpatient hem/onc regarding how to best manage concerning 
lesions. 

#Breast mass ___ mammogram showing BI-RADS 5, Solid mass 
in the 3 o'clock left breast with features of a highly 
suspicious for malignancy. Per patient's son, she has seen a 
doctor for evaluating the new breast mass. Would recommend 
ongoing discussion with aforementioned doctor and outpatient 
hem/onc about plan to manage.

# HLD: continued atorvastatin without changes. Consider 
evaluation regarding stopping atorvastatin on outpatient basis 
 
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine without changes.   
  
#HCP:  Dr. ___ (son, ___ physician) ___
#Code status: full code (confirmed with patient on ___
