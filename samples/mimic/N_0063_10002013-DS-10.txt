Pertinent Results:
CT ABD/PELVIS ___:
Noncontrast imaging of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a 
punctate 
nonobstructing calculus in the right collecting system (02:31). 
There is no left renal calculus. There is no evidence of 
ureteral or urinary bladder calculus. There is symmetric renal 
enhancement and excretion of intravenous contrast. Subcentimeter 
cortically based hypodensity in the left interpolar region 
(06:30) is too small to accurately characterize but likely 
represents renal cyst. There is no evidence of collecting system 
filling defect. There are segments of the mid to distal ureters 
are not well opacified, possibly secondary to peristalsis, 
however there is no evidence of inflammatory change or mass 
about the ureters. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. 
  
Low hepatic attenuation on noncontrast imaging is consistent 
with hepatic 
steatosis. There is no evidence of focal hepatic mass. There is 
no 
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There 
are numerous gallstones within the gallbladder without evidence 
of acute cholecystitis. 
  
The spleen is not enlarged. There is no pancreatic ductal 
dilatation or 
evidence of pancreatic mass. 
  
There are no dilated loops of bowel. There is no evidence of 
bowel wall 
thickening. There is no intraperitoneal free air or free fluid. 
  
There are no enlarged inguinal, iliac chain, retrocrural, or 
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal aorta has a normal course 
and caliber with moderate atherosclerotic calcification. There 
is atherosclerotic calcification of the superior mesenteric 
artery origin. There is no suspicious osseous lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Tiny nonobstructing right collecting system calculus. 
2. Hepatic steatosis. 
3. 3 nodular pulmonary densities in the left basilar region 
measuring up to 8 x 8 mm. These findings may may represent areas 
of rounded atelectasis, however short-term followup with 
nonemergent CT chest is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH with HTN, GERD, CAD s/p CABG and stenting, IDDM with R 
flank pain presumed to musculoskeletal in nature due to negative 
workup. Incidental UTI / asymptomatic bacturia.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
# UTI / Bacturia: Patient presented without any history of 
urinary or systemic symptoms, but was started on ceftriaxone in 
the ED after U/A with ___ positive and 19 WBCs. 
Antibiotics were taken prior to drawing urinary or blood 
cultures, and there was no yield. Patient switched to 
ciprofloxacin and received a three day total antibiotic course. 
CT scan performed did not have any evidence of pyelonephritis. 
Antibiotics were discontinued at time of discharge.

# Flank Pain: 
Patient reported 3 weeks of back/flank pain, constant and achy 
in nature and worsened by movement. Treated with 
anti-inflammatories with minimal effect. CT scan demonstrated no 
nephrolithiasis. CXR showed no bony abnormality, but could not 
totally exclude multiple rib fractures. Patient's pain was well 
controlled and tolerating PO medications, so she was discharged 
with PCP following for further workup.

# Diabetes / Hyperglycemia:
Patient had persistently 

# IDDM: Last A1C (___) 8.0. Serum glucose initially in the 400s 
and Chem-7 with gap; however, this was likely ___ lactate and 
unlikely to be DKA given normal pH on ABG. AM glucose 218.
- continue home dose lantus 90 units qPM  
- per ___ records, is on a very aggressive ISS, will decrease 
for now and uptitrate as necessary depending on ___  

# ___ on CKD: Cr elevated at 1.4 from baseline 1.0. Most likely 
pre-renal in the setting of infection. Now s/p 2L IVF in the ED 
and creatinine has corrected to 1.0. Appears euvolemic, maybe 
slightly up. 
- consider further workup if no improvement (urine lytes, 
spinning urine, renal u/s)  
- renally dose medications for now  

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HF with pEF/CAD s/p CABG and stents: Was not an active issue 
whil inpatient. Fluid use was judicious. Metoprolo converted to 
short acting while in house, isosorbide, aspirin and 
atorvastatin were continued. Losartan held as below.  
# HTN: home metoprolol and isosorbide continued, losartan held 
while inpt as pressures were soft and within normal range. 
Discharged home off losartan.
# Restless leg syndrome: home ropinarole continued
# Shoulder pain: oxycodone and tylenol seperately dose while 
inpatient  
# COPD: home advair and PRN albuterol nebs were continued  
# GERD: home pantoprazole continued 
# Insomnia: home trazodone continued  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Losartan held inpatient and at discharge andpatient blood 
pressures were low-normal. PCP to determine restart.
- Patient to follow up with PCP for resolution of UTI and back 
pain symptoms
- Patient should have insulin regiment adjustments for optimal 
glycemic control - no changes to regimen were made at discharge.
