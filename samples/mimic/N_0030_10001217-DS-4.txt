Pertinent Results:
___ MRI HEAD W/WO CONTRAST 
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Ring-enhancing lesion identified in the area of the right 
precentral 
sulcus frontal lobe, with associated vasogenic edema, restricted 
diffusion, possibly consistent with an abscess, other entities 
cannot be completely ruled out such as metastases or primary 
brain neoplasm. 
  
2.  Multiple FLAIR and T2 hyperintense lesions in the 
subcortical white matter along the callososeptal region, 
consistent with known multiple sclerosis disease. 

___ MRI HEAD W/ CONTRAST 
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged ring-enhancing lesion identified in the 
area of the 
right precentral sulcus of the frontal lobe, with associated 
vasogenic edema.  The differential diagnosis again includes 
possible abscess, other entities, however, cannot be completely 
excluded. 

___ NON CONTRAST HEAD CT 
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Status post right parietal craniotomy with mixed density 
lesion in the 
right precentral sulcus and surrounding edema not significantly 
changed from prior MR of ___ allowing for 
difference in technique.  
  
2.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular 
territorial infarct.  
  
3.  Bifrontal subcortical white matter hypodensities compatible 
with 
underlying multiple sclerosis.  

___ 2:37 am CSF;SPINAL FLUID      TUBE #1. 

   GRAM STAIN (Final ___: 
      NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN. 
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN. 
      This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, 
please refer to
      hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count.. 

   FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ presented to the ___ Emergency Department on 
___ with left-sided numbness of her hand and face and left 
hand clumsiness.  She was evaluated in the ED and initially 
believed to have an MS flare and she was evaluted by Neurology 
service which resulted in the recommendation for an MRI brain.  
The MRI was read to demonstrate a right parietal lesion 
concerning for MS, metastatic disease or abscess. She was 
admitted to Neurosurgery for further evaluation and treatment.  

On ___, Mrs. ___ was taken to the OR for a right 
parietal craniotomy with cordisectomy, drainage and irrigation 
of brain abscess. She tolerated the procedure well. She was 
taken to PACU to recover then to the ICU. ID recommmend 
Vancomycin and Meropenem. Gram stain PRELIM: gram negative rods 
and gram positive cocci in pairs and chains. Post operative head 
CT showed post operative changes. On post operative exam she had 
left arm weakness. 

On ___ the patient continued on vancomycin and Meropenem. 
WBC was elevated to 19.0 from 15.7 on ___. She was 
transferred to the floor. Left arm weakness was slightly 
improved. the patient reported lethargy and left leg weakness. 
on exam the patient was sleepy but awake.  she was oriented to 
person place and time.  right sided strength was ___ and left 
upper extremity was ___ and left lower extremity was full except 
for IP which was 5-. A stat NCHCT was performed which was 
stable.

On ___, consent for picc line placement obtained, picc line 
placed by IV nurse. She will continue with vanco and meropenum 
IV. Final abcess culture result is still pending. Exam remains 
stable. 

On ___ ___ evaluated the patient and found that she continues 
to have an unsteady gait and would not be safe to go home.  They 
planned to visit her again on ___ for re-evaluation and to 
perform stair maneuvers with her. The final results on the 
abcess culture was streptococcus Milleri. New ID recommendations 
were to discontiniu Vanco and Meropenum, she was started on 
Ceftriaxone 2 grams and and Flagyl Tid. 

On ___, patient was re-evaluated by ___ and OT and cleared to be 
discharged home with the assistance of a cane. They also 
recommend services while patient is at home. She remained stable
