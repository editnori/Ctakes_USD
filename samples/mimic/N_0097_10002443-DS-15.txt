History of Present Illness:
 HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mr. ___ is a ___
male with rheumatoid arthritis, DMARD holiday, and recent, brief
hospitalization for presumptive pericarditis, returned to 
outside
hospital with probable cardiac tamponade now post-bedside
pericardiocentesis with drain placement prior to transfer.
Importantly, patient was hospitalized at ___ on ___ with acute pleuritic chest pain of two-day duration in the
context of constellation of fatigue, malaise, upper respiratory
symptoms, and non-productive cough. While CTA exonerated
pulmonary embolism, thickened pericardium and small effusion 
were
noted, suggesting pericarditis. ECG revealed subtle diffuse ST
elevations in keeping with pericarditis. Echocardiogram 
confirmed
said effusion, though no features of tamponade were appreciated.
He was discharged the same day with ibuprofen 600 mg TID and
colchicine 0.6 mg BID. He had persistence of minor residual 
chest
pain, which began to worsen two days later, but was tolerable
until yesterday evening when it evolved to severe, unrelenting
pain across his precordium likened to "wearing shoulder pads
bearing down on him." He notes a new concurrent substernal chest
pain that "goes straight to his back." He then became dyspneic,
prompting him to seek care. He arrived at ___ hypotensive
with SBP in the 80-range. He was borderline tachycardic and in
mild respiratory distress, but oxygenation was acceptable. He
rapidly received three liters of fluid for presumptive tamponade
within the confines of poor windows on bedside echocardiogram.
Pericardiocentesis yielded 400 cc or more of serous fluid and a
pericardial drain was placed. Hemodynamics rapidly improved. On
arrival to ___ ED, patient was indeed hemodynamically stable
but was then in moderate respiratory distress, requiring
non-rebreather. He was given Lasix 20 mg IV. Bedside
echocardiogram was limited, but preliminarily suggestive of 
small
residual effusion. In the CCU, patient notes resurgence of said
chest pain. His dyspnea is improving. An additional 250 cc was
drained.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: 
===================== 
___ male with rheumatoid arthritis, DMARD holiday, and
recent, brief hospitalization for presumptive pericarditis,
returned to outside hospital with pericardial effusion with 
possible tamponade physiology now post-bedside 
pericardiocentesis prior to transfer, with persistent 
pericardial effusion now s/p drain placement with course 
complicated by acute hypercapneic respiratory distress. 

#CORONARIES: unknown.
#PUMP: normal biventricular structure and function. 
#RHYTHM: NSR. pAF ___

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] He was discharged on ibuprofen 600mg TID and colchicine 0.6mg 
BID for his inflammatory pericarditis. He should continue 
colchicine for 3 months. He should have his ibuprofen tapered 
weekly following resolution of his symptoms over 3 weeks to 
reduce the risk of recurrence. 
[] He was discharged on a PPI and should continue this while on 
ibuprofen. 
[] Strongly recommend that patient receive outpatient PFTs given 
high suspicion for baseline obstructive/restrictive pulmonary 
disease 
[] Patient developed paroxysmal afib with RVR during this 
admission which is a new diagnosis. CHADSVASC 2 for hypertension 
and diabetes. Anticoagulation was not started during this 
admission given that he was felt to have relatively low risk for 
CVA, however please make a note of this new diagnosis and 
reassess need for anticoagulation as medically appropriate. 
[] He was newly diagnosed with DM (HbA1c 7.9 at ___ 
and will be discharged on metformin 500 BID. Will require 
outpatient follow-up for this and can consider uptitration in 
the outpatient setting. 
[] Please reassess need for diuretic in the outpatient setting. 
He had no echocardiographic evidence of heart failure during 
this admission so was not discharged on diuretics. 

New medications:
Metformin 500mg BID
Metoprolol XL 50mg QD 
Omeprazole 20mg QD 

Continued medications:
Atorvastatin 10mg QPM
Colchicine 0.6mg BID
Ibuprofen 600mg TID
Folic acid 1mg PO QD
Sertraline 100mg PO QD

Stopped medications: 
Methotrexate 20mg PO
Famotidine 20mg QD

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============
#) Acute pericarditis
#) Cardiac tamponade, now s/p pericardiocentesis and drain
placement 
He presented with inflammatory pericarditis of probable viral 
nature in the context of viral-like prodrome versus rheumatic 
pericarditis, given serologic positive active disease in the 
absence of DMARD. Pericardial fluid cultures from ___ 
negative, cultures here with 1 colony on 1 plate of coag 
negative staph felt to be contaminant, negative acid fast smear. 
No biochemical evidence of myocardial injury on admission, 
unlikely to have concurrent myocarditis or cardiac event 
sequelae. At ___ was initially noted to have SBPs in 
the ___ and received fluid resuscitation and pericardiocentesis 
given concern for tamponade physiology. Hemodynamics 
subsequently stabilized and remained so throughout the duration 
of his admission here. TTE on ___ showed no pericardial 
effusion. Pericardial drain was initially left to gravity due to 
continued output, and was removed ___. He was treated with 
colchicine 0.6mg BID which he will continue for 3 months after 
discharge. He also received ibuprofen 600mg PO TID and will be 
discharged on a slow taper; he received PPI while receiving 
NSAIDs. 

#) Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure - resolving
Probable flash pulmonary edema from rapid large-volume fluid 
administration on tamponade, as evidenced by radiographic 
pulmonary edema. Earlier echocardiogram otherwise not suggestive 
of ventricular dysfunction and BNP is within normal limits. TTE 
on ___ was without evidence of cardiac etiology for his 
pulmonary edema/respiratory failure.
Patient likely has unappreciated restrictive pulmonary 
physiology. Additionally, no emphysematous changes noted on CT 
one week ago, but
background obstructive defect is conceivable, given compelling
smoking history. He had a negative CTA one week prior to 
admission. Patient had leukocytosis on admission without clear 
radiographic consolidation suggestive of pneumonia - one dose of 
empiric azithromycin was given overnight and discontinued on 
___. He received IV diuresis with significant improvement in 
his respiratory status. O2 weaned ___ morning. He was breathing 
comfortably on RA at the time of discharge with ambulatory 
saturations >90%. 

#) Paroxysmal AFib, new diagnosis 
Patient went into Afib with RVR on ___, and subsequently 
received metoprolol. He subsequently flipped back into NSR. His 
CHADsVASC = 2 (DM, HTN). Anticoagulation was discussed but 
ultimately deferred at the time of discharge given the patient's 
lower overall risk for CVA and concerns regarding medication 
adherence/cost. He was discharged on metoprolol. He should have 
his need for anticoagulation reassessed as an outpatient as 
medically appropriate. 

#) Type II diabetes: 
He was newly diagnosed with DM with a A1C of 7.9% during this 
admission. He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale during 
this admission and will be discharged on metformin 500mg BID. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
====================
#) Rheumatoid arthritis: 
RF and anti-CCP positive per outpatient rheumatology. Not
currently endorsing sx suggestive of RA flare. Per discussion
with OP rheumatologist, deferred restarting MTX and/or other
DMARD until outpatient.

#) HTN
His home BP meds were held initially due to soft BPs and were 
stopped at the time of discharge as he remained normotensive.
