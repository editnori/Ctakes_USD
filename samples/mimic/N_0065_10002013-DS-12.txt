ECHO ___
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA volume index. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF>55%). Doppler 
parameters are most consistent with normal LV diastolic 
function. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery. 

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels. 

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. 
___ mitral valve supporting structures. No MS. 

___ VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial 
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized. 
No PS. Physiologic PR. 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.   
Conclusions   
 The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic 
function (biplane LVEF = 63 %). Doppler parameters are most 
consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic function. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1) Normal biventricular regional/global systolic function. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
no clinically significant change noted

mid LAD ___, DES to edge ISR of mid LAD DES and stenosis distal 
to stent ___, DES to ___, s/p 3 v CABG LIMA-LAD, 
SVG-OM1, SVG-D1(occluded) ___, HFpEF, IDDM, HTN who 
presented with several days atypical chest pain both with 
exertion and at rest, with mild T wave deepening but no other 
EKG changes or troponin. She also presented with mild DKA and 
diabetic foot ulcer. She had a stress test with reversible 
ischemia in the LAD territory (___) and went to cardiac 
catheterization ___ which showed stable disease and no new 
obstructive lesions. Overall her chest pain was felt to have 
been either musculoskeletal or demand in the setting of DKA and 
diabetic foot ulcer. She was discharged on ASA 81, atorvastatin 
80, Metoprolol XL 100mg daily. 

#DKA/IDDM: Patient presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis 
and felt to be in mild DKA. She had insulin gtt in the ED but 
was rapidly switched to subcutaneous insulin. Her A1c returned 
at 12%, which is the highest it has been recorded for her in our 
records. She had followed with ___ previously and was 
on canagliflozin and glipizide as well as SC insulin prior to 
admission. However, she reported intermittent adherence to her 
medications and this was the likely reason for her DKA. While 
she was in house the ___ followed along and she met 
with a diabetes educator. Her canagliflozin was stopped at 
discharge due to increased risk of amputation. 

#Diabetic foot ulcer: Present for at least 3 weeks prior to 
admission. She underwent bedside debridement by Podiatry in ED. 
XR suggested presence of osteomyelitis . She was maintained on 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl in house, and was switched to cipro/clinda 
at discharge per podiatry recs with plans for close follow up. 
Her wound swab at time of discharge was polymicrobial but was 
growing Group B strep (sensitivities pending) and klebsiella 
(pan sensitive). 

#Med noncompliance: She reported intermittent medication 
compliance related to difficulty remembering to take her 
medications as well as periods of depression and stress where 
taking her medication was not a priority. She has recently 
obtained a pillbox and her granddaughter is helping her with 
remembering to take her medications. 

#HFpEF: Metoprolol as above, continued torsemide 20mg and she 
appeared euvolemic throughout admission. 
#HL: Continued atorvastatin
#HTN: Metoprolol lowered to XL 100mg daily, losartan kept at 
25mg daily. Imdur stopped.
#COPD: Duonebs q6h in house, continued home inhalers on 
discharge. 
#Restless legs: continued ropinerole 

Transitional issues: 
- Please follow up her diabetic foot ulcer in ___ clinic. 
Plan at time of discharge was to take to OR for further surgical 
debridement, patient was discharged with cipro/clinda until 
Podiatry follow up 
- Please review her blood sugars at home and continue to 
reinforce compliance with diabetes medications. Her 
Canagliflozin was stopped due to increased risk of amputation. 
Consider reintroducing metformin as this was stopped ___ years ago 
for diarrhea but may be a better option for her. 
- Follow up blood pressures and heart rate on the current 
regimen. Suspect that due to noncompliance her medications were 
uptitrated to higher doses than she actually needs. We cut back 
her Metoprolol and stoped her imdur
- Can restart imdur if requiring for chest pain on outpatient 
basis
- Please continue to work with patient on med compliance and 
possible barriers. She denied depression with our social worker 
but does endorse that stress makes it hard to take her 
medications. 
- f/u final wound swab cultures

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
 - You were admitted because you had chest pain. 
 - You also had a process called DKA from not taking enough 
insulin 
 - You also had a bad infection in your foot. 

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
 -  We did several tests to figure our if your chest pain was 
caused by a heart attack. The first was a stress test, which had 
a positive results. We then did a procedure called a cardiac 
cath, which showed that you did NOT have a heart attack. 
 - Our podiatrists did a debridement of your foot. 
 - We gave you antibiotics for your foot. 
 - We adjusted your insulin levels. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Take all of your medications: 
  - Ciproflocaxin and Clindamycin are antibiotics you need to 
take until the podiatrists tell you to stop.  You are scheduled 
to see them ___
  - Your insulin regimen will be slightly different from your 
old regimen. 
  - You need to take aspirin and Atorvastatin every day to 
prevent blockages in your heart from forming. 
 - You will have many appointments in the next week. It is very 
important that you go to all of these, to help get your health 
on track! 
 - Your weight at discharge is 79.1 kg   (174.38 lb) . Please 
weigh yourself today at home and use this as your new baseline  
 -Please weigh yourself every day in the morning. Call your 
doctor if your weight goes up by more than 3 lbs.  
 - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms 
or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or 
shortness of breath. If you have worsening pain or redness in 
your foot, urinating frequently or very thirsty, or if your 
blood sugar is consistently above 300 or below 70 please cal 
your doctor.
