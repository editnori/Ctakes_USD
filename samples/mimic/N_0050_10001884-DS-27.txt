Brief Hospital Course:
To Do:
1) follow-up theophylline level
___ yo F smoker with PMH of asthma/COPD managed with theophylline 
until ___ when theophylline was discontinued because of 
tachycardia, CAD, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented from 
home with asymptomatic tachyarrythmia.
.  
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Tachycarrhymia in context of recent inducible ischemia seen on 
ECHO stress test (___):  At the time of admission, her 
symptoms had resolved, no abnormalities were seen on imaging or 
labs, and her VS and PEx were remarkable only for non-acute lung 
findings.  MI was ruled out by trop negative x3, no EKG changes. 
 Cardiology was consulted to evaluate need for catheterization 
vs other intervention, but did not feel that any urgent 
inpatient work-up was necessary, especially in the context of 
asymptomatic tachycardia.  She had already had Holter and ECHO 
prior to this admission.  Cardiology recommended restarting 
theophylline if, in fact, she received such benefit from 
pulmonary point of view.  She was restarted on theophylline 
200mg TID, which was her dose prior to discontinuation.  She 
received tobacco cessation education, was continued on home 
diltiazem and aspirin (dose was temporarily increased to 325mg 
prior to ruling out MI).  Admission theopylline level was 
pending at the time of discharge.
.  
# Asthma and COPD: patient was given Albuterol and ipratropium 
nebs, and she was continued on her home doses of fluticasone, 
montelukast, fluticasone-salmetrol.  She was given O2 PRN.  
After cardiology consult, she was restarted on her theophylline 
at 200mg TID, with pulm and cardiology follow-up.
.  
# Tobacco abuse: she declined nicotine patch, and education was 
given regarding the health hazards of smoking.
.  
# HL: patient was continued oh her simvastatin, but because her 
LDL was not at goal (<70), her dose was increased to 40mg daily.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# HTN: continued isosorbide and hydrochlorothiazide at home 
doses.
.
