ACTIVE ISSUES
=================
# Shortness of Breath: Patient with history of COPD and recent 
admission for dyspnea in the setting of steroid taper. Her 
symptoms on presentation were consistent with severe COPD given 
diffuse wheezing and poor air movement. She likely had an 
exacerbation in the setting of a decrease in her steroids. There 
may also be a component of anxiety. She underwent CT last 
admission that was negative for infections such as ___. She was 
continued on home spiriva, theophylline, advair. She was started 
on standing duonebs q6h and albuterol q2h prn and prednisone was 
started at 40mg daily with slow taper. She was also given 
azithromycin to complete 5 day course. She had improvement in 
her wheezing and returned to baseline O2 requirement after 48 
hours. She was seen by ___ who felt that she would benefit from 
discharge to inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. On DC 
to ___ rehab, recommended continued Prendisone 40mg 
daily for 1x week with slow taper by 5mg every 5 days. ___ also 
consider starting bactrim ppx with extended duration of steroids 
if unable to wean less than 20mg qd. Will also f/u as outpatient 
with pulm.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
==================
# Anxiety/Insomnia: Continued home lorazepam. Consider starting 
SRRI as an outpatient. 
# Atrial Fibrillation: Continued dilt for rate control and 
apixaban for anticoagulation.
# Hypertension: Continued home imdur, hydrochlorothiazide, and 
diltiazem.
# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ without evidence of 
significant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ with EF > 
55% and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. 
Continued home aspirin and atorvastatin.
# Anemia: Continued home iron supplements.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==========================
[] For pt's continued COPD exacerbations, recommend finishing 5d 
course of Azithromycin, 250mg qd until ___
[] Recommend extended prednisone taper for pt, 5d 40mg 
Prednisone (to finish ___ followed by 10mg taper every 5 days 
(35mg from ___, 30mg ___, etc...). 
[] Would consider PCP prophylaxis with ___ if unable to wean
