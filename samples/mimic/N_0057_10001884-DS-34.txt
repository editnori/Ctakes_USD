History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with a PMH notable for COPD on 
home O2(hospitalized ___, multiple recent ED visits), Afib on 
apixaban, HTN, CAD, and HLD who presents with several days of 
worsening dyspnea.

Patient has had several ED visits for dyspnea and a recent 
hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation in ___. She has 
been on steroid therapy with several attempts to taper over the 
last several months. After her most recent ED visit on ___ 
she was on placed on 60 mg PO prednisone with a taper down by 10 
mg each day. Her SOB worsened with the taper and she was seen on 
___ by her PCP who started her on a course of prednisone 30 mg 
PO to be tapered down by 5 mg every 3 days. With the taper she 
is currently on prednisone 25 mg QD.

She reports that her SOB improved slightly after starting the 
steroids on ___. However, last night it acutely worsened and she 
was unable to sleep. She usually uses 3 pillows to sleep but was 
only comfortable seated upright last night. This morning she 
increased her oxygen to 3L and felt better. She is usually on 2L 
NC at home. She reports that for the last several months she has 
been using two different albuterol inhalers each every ___ 
hours. She knows that this is more than they are prescribed for 
but it makes her comfortable. She mostly stays put on the second 
floor of her home. She states that she can walk to the bathroom 
without being short of breath, but does not use the stairs 
unless she has to leave the house because it worsens her 
breathing. She endorses a cough occasionally productive of ___ 
sputum. This is consistent with her baseline. She endorses one 
episode of non-exertional chest pain today that spontaneously 
resolved. She denies fever, chills, recent sick contacts, and 
lower extremity edema.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 98.5 P 80 BP 154/97 R 20 
O2 sat 97% NC.  
- Exam notable for: Diffuse expiratory wheezing, prolonged 
expiratory phase, left inspiratory crackles, irregularly 
irregular rhthym, minimal pedal edema  
- Labs were notable for CBC wnl, proBNP 235, Trop 0.02, chem 
notable for bicarb 31, AG 13, UA notable for 40 RBCs  
- Studies performed include CXR with stable mild/moderate 
cardiomegaly, atelectasis at bases, otherwise clear lung fields
- Patient was given Albuterol neb x 1, ipratropium neb x 1, 
Azithromycin 500 mg PO, Prednisone 25 mg PO

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient states that she is doing 
well. She says that her SOB has improved since this morning and 
is better than last night when she could not sleep.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with a PMH notable for COPD on 
home O2 (hospitalized ___, multiple recent ED visits), Afib 
on apixaban, HTN, CAD, and HLD who presented with dyspnea and 
orthopnea in the setting of a steroid taper for recent COPD 
exacerbation. Her dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial due 
to her severe COPD and with a component of anxiety. The patient 
was not thought to be having an acute COPD exacerbation.

================
ACTIVE ISSUES:
================

# Dyspnea: Patient was admitted after one night of worsened 
orthopnea and dyspnea in the setting of a steroid taper from 30 
mg to 25 mg. Her dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial due to 
her severe COPD and with a component of anxiety. The patient was 
not thought to be having an acute COPD exacerbation. The patient 
was treated with occasional duonebs and lorazepam 0.5 mg PRN 
that helped relieve her dyspnea. Pulmonology was consulted. The 
patient underwent CT that showed emphysema but no evidence of 
infection such as ___. The patient was initiated on a steroid 
taper on ___ of prednisone 30 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for 3 
days, then 10 mg until outpatient follow-up. Pulmonology 
recommended increasing her Advair dose to 500/50, which was 
done. They also recommended switching from theophylline to 
roflumilast and initiation of long-term azithromycin therapy 
provided the patient's QTc was not prolonged; this was deferred 
to the outpatient setting. Throughout her admission she had O2 
sats greater than 95% on 2L NC. She did not desaturate on 
ambulation. 

# Anxiety/Insomnia: Patient with a history of anxiety and 
insomnia, thought to be contributing to her experience of 
dyspnea. The patient was discharged with lorazepam Q8H as needed 
for anxiety. The patient would likely benefit from therapy with 
an SSRI.

# Demand Ischemia: Patient with troponin 0.02, <0.01, then 0.02. 
ECG without acute ischemic changes.

# Microscopic hematuria: On admission the patient had a UA with 
40 RBCs. Occasional UAs over the last year in OMR with 
microscopic hematuria. Would recommend repeat UA as an 
outpatient or work-up for microscopic hematuria.

================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
================

# Smoking: Patient recently quit smoking one month ago. Patient 
was provided with a nicotine patch 7 mg while in house; could 
consider continuing as an outpatient if patient endorses 
cravings.

# Atrial fibrillation: Patient continued on diltiazem 240 mg PO 
BID and apixaban 5 mg BID.

# HTN: Patient with a history of hypertension. Blood pressure 
well-controlled. Continued on isosorbide mononitrate ER 240 mg 
PO daily and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg PO daily.

# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ without evidence of 
significant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ with EF>55% 
and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. The patient 
was continued on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 10 mg QPM.

===================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
#New Medications:
-Prednisone 30 mg PO QD through ___, then on ___ mg for 3 
days, then on ___ mg until outpatient follow-up
-Increased Advair (Fluticasone-Salmeterol) to 500/50 dose
-Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q8H PRN for anxiety

#Follow-up:
-Appointment arranged with PCP, ___ ___
-Appointment arranged with Pulmonologist, Dr. ___, ___

#COPD: Patient was seen by pulmonology during admission who had 
the following recommendations to consider as an outpatient.
-Switch to roflumilast from theophylline
-Daily azithromycin for treatment of chronic inflammation 
provided QTc within normal limits.
-Patient may benefit from treatment of anxiety with an SSRI, as 
her anxiety is likely contributing to her experience of dyspnea.
-In the future, palliative care consult for consideration of 
opioid treatment of dyspnea

#Microscopic hematuria: Patient had a UA with 40 RBCs on 
admission 
-Recommend repeat UA as an outpatient or work-up for microscopic 
hematuria

#Lung nodule: New left lower lobe nodule, potentially measuring 
as large as 6 x 8 mm, warrants close follow-up.  Stable to 
slightly smaller 4 mm right middle lobe nodule. Follow-up CT in 
___ months as per ___ guidelines for evaluation 
of new left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

#Code Status: Full code
#Emergency Contact/HCP: ___ (HUSBAND) ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a privilege taking care of you during your admission to 
___. You were admitted to the hospital for 
shortness of breath and concern that you were having a flare of 
your COPD.

While in the hospital we increased your dose of steroids to help 
your breathing. You also received several nebulizer treatments 
that helped your breathing. You were also expressing some 
anxiety that may have been contributing to your shortness of 
breath. You were given a medication called Ativan for your 
anxiety that also seemed to help your breathing.

During your admission you were seen by the pulmonary 
specialists. They recommended a CT scan that showed that you 
have extensive COPD but did not show any infection. They also 
suggested increasing the dose of your Advair inhaler, which we 
did.

If you feel short of breath, first please check your oxygen 
level. If it is less than 90, you can use oxygen and your 
inhaler. If not, try to wait a few minutes, take a few deep 
breaths and see if your shortness of breath improves. You can 
use the medication called Ativan(lorazepam) to help with the 
shortness of breath(no more than three times a day). If still 
not improved, you can use one of the inhalers/oxygen. 

Please follow-up with all your appointments as listed below and 
continue to take all of your medications as prescribed. If you 
experience any of the danger signs listed you should call your 
doctor immediately or go to the Emergency Room.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
