Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ y/o F with PMHx CHF, Afib not on 
anticoagulation, severe advanced Alzheimer's dementia, 
osteoporosis, HTN, who presents from assisted living facility 
with R hip pain, found to have DVT left common femoral vein with 
volume overload. During a meeting with patient and her family, 
decision was made to transition care to comfort-directed 
measures only and to pursue hospice services on discharge. 

ACTIVE ISSUES 
=============
# CMO. The team had a family meeting on ___ and decision was 
made to transition care to CMO and pursue 24 hour hospice 
services on discharge. Family did not want to pursue active 
treatments such as Lasix, which would make her uncomfortable 
given incontinence or shots such as lovenox for treatment of 
DVT. Home medications metoprolol, donepezil and Memantine were 
continued for comfort. She was discharged to an ___ 
___ facility. 

OTHER HOSPITAL ISSUES 
=====================

# DVT. Deep vein thrombosis of the left common femoral vein 
extending into at least the popliteal vein diagnosed on 
ultrasound on admission. This was likely acquired in the setting 
of immobility, as the patient had been restricted to her 
wheelchair at her assisted living for greater than 1 month due 
to deconditioning. She was initially started on Lovenox for 
treatment but this was discontinued in the setting of transition 
to care to CMO as above. 

# Acute CHF. Patient was volume overloaded on presentation with 
pleural effusions. She was diuresed with IV Lasix. Home 
metoprolol was continued at a decreased dose. In the setting of 
transition to care to CMO, Lasix was discontinued. She was 
continued on metoprolol for comfort. She remained on room air 
without respiratory distress.  

# Afib. She presented in sinus rhythm, rate controlled on 
metoprolol. Metoprolol was continued at a decreased dose for 
comfort. 

# Hip pain. The right hip pain that she presented with was 
resolved by the time of admission. Pelvic xray was without 
fracture. She was treated with Tylenol scheduled for pain 
control. 

# Al___ Dementia. She was AOx1 at her baseline per family 
members. She was continued on Aricept/Namenda.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
===================

- ___ facility to continue writing orders for 
pain/anxiety/secretions and other symptoms. 
- Continued metoprolol succinate and Memantine and donepezil on 
discharge for comfort. Continuation of these medications can be 
further decided at inpatient hospice. 
- MOLST form: DNR/DNI, do not re-hospitalize
