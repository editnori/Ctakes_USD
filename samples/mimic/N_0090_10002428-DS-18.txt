History of Present Illness:
This is an ___ year old woman, recently hospitalized for C. 
Difficile sepsis and shock, complicated by readmission 
hypoxia/hypercarbia (___) who presents with respiratory 
distress and respiratory failure.
.
The patient had reportedly been doing well ___ rehab until today 
when she was noted to have an altered (depressed) mental status, 
tachypnea, and dyspnea.  EMS was called who found the patient ___ 
extremis, intubation was attempted x2 and failed.  A ___ airway 
was placed and the patient was transported to ___ emergency 
department.  There were no reports of increased coughing or 
stooling from ___.
.
The patient has had a complicated medical course ___ the past 
month - 
.
___ brief, the patient was initially discharge on ___ after 
a 14 hosptilazation for c.diff colitis complicated by sepsis and 
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  On the 
day following discharge from that admission, the patient was 
noted to be complaining of worsening SOB and ABG at ___ 
was 7.4/___. She was re-admitted to ___ on ___ to the MICU 
and intially reuqired biPAP for HD1-2. Her oxygen requirement on 
d/c was 2L NC.   The etiology of her hypercarbic respiratory 
failure was felt to be ___ hypoventilation from somnolence 
related to oversedation with zyprexa which was held on 
discharge. A CTA chest was negative for PE and showed no clear 
evidence of pneumonia.  She was initially started on HCAP 
antibiotics with vanc/cefepime which were stopped on HD 4 prior 
to discharge given that all cultures were negative and there was 
no consolidation on imaging. 
.

spontaneous respirations O(2)Sat: 100;  Initial labs 
demonstrated hct 22.0, wbc 16.0, creatinine 0.3, BIN 18, lipase 
148 and lactate 0.9. A cxr demonstrated bilateral pleural 
effusions with R>L.   A UA demonstrated large leuks, positive 
nitrites and 104 wbc.  Due respiratory failure the patient was 
intubated.  
.
An initial ABG was 7.___/128 which was 7.___/395 post 
intubation.  The patient was given vancomycin and cefepime for 
coverage of both a urinary and pulmonary source. Post intubation 
her BP dropped to the ___. She was started on levophed and 
phenylephrine through her existing PICC line. Given her altered 
mental status on arrival, a head CT was performed which showed 
no acute findings. Vitals on transfer were: 36.3 66 118 107/58 
99%. 
.
Vent settings were: fio2 60% RR 18 Vt 400 peep 5. Sedation with 
midazolam and fentanyl. She was transferred on levophed alone w/ 
MAPs> 70.
.   
On arrival to the MICU,  vitals were: 36.2 106/58 77 18 (vented) 
100% on 40% FiO2.  The patient was on a levophed drip, was not 
sedated, was unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli, was 
thought to have a brief episode of decerebrate posturing with

AP CHEST X-RAY (___): 
1. Bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left. 
Underlying 
consolidation cannot be completely excluded. 
2. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.8 cm above the carina. 
Recommend 
repositioning. 
3. NG tube terminates ___ stomach with sidehole ___ distal 
esophagus. 
3. Right PICC terminates ___ the axilla. 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST (___): There is no evidence of 
hemorrhage, edema, infarction, or mass effect. The ventricles 
and sulci are prominent, suggesting age-related involutional 
changes or atrophy. Periventricular white matter hypodensities 
are compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Basal 
cisterns appear patent, and there is preservation of gray-white 
matter differentiation. No fracture is identified. There is 
fluid within the nasal cavity, likely secondary to intubated 
state.  Atherosclerotic mural calcifications of the internal 
carotid arteries are present. The visualized paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are otherwise clear. 
Bilateral ocular lenses have been replaced. IMPRESSION: No 
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 

TTE (___): The left atrium is normal ___ size. There is mild 
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study dated ___ (images reviewed), 
findings are similar.  

AP UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY (___): Compared to the most recent 
study, there is improvement ___ the mild pulmonary edema and 
decrease ___ the small left pleural effusion. Moderate right 
pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis are stable. 

AP UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY (___): Cardiac size is normal. Lines 
and tubes are ___ the standard position. Large right and moderate 
left pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the 
differences ___ positioning of the patient. Right upper lobe 
opacity has improved consistent with improving atelectasis. 
Pleural effusions are associated with atelectasis, larger on the 
right side. There is mild vascular congestion. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is an ___ year old woman, recently hospitalized for C. 
Difficile sepsis and shock, complicated by readmission 
hypoxia/hypercarbia (___) p/w hypercarbic respiratory 
failure and urinary tract infection. 
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Etiology likely 
multifactorial, primarily respiratory muscle weakness and pulm 
edema with pleural effusions as noted on admission x-ray (has 
history of 2+ mitral regurg). She remained intubated for most of 
her MICU stay due to pulmonary edema and respiratory muscle 
weakness with a poor negative inspiratory force (NIF). Her NIF 
gradually improved with optimization of her nutrition and 
supportive care. Her pulmonary edema was addressed with 
aggressive diuresis with IV and PO Lasix boluses (responds well 
to Lasix 10mg IV). With treatment of these issues, she was able 
to be successfully extubated to nasal cannula on ___. She 
was started on Lisinopril 5mg daily for afterload reduction ___ 
setting of her 2+ MR which may have been causing the pulmonary 
edema. She may require further PRN doses of Lasix at rehab; if 
so would try Lasix 20mg PO PRN. Consider increasing lisinopril 
to 10mg for better afterload reduction pressure tolerating.
.
# Pseudomonas UTI: Patient grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to 
everything but Gentamicin on ___ urine culture. She was 
initially started on double coverage with Cipro/Cefepime while 
cultures pending, then narrowed to Cefepime alone, then 
broadened to Meropenam per ID recs. There was concern that 
Meropenam caused a drug rash so she was then switched to IV 
Zosyn. She completed Zosyn course on ___, received total of 10 
days antibiotics for complicated UTI. 
.
# RASH: pt noted to have red macular rash on extremities after 
starting meropenam, initially presumed to be meropenam drug rash 
so meropenam was stopped. However this was later believed to be 
more consistent with contact dermatitis vs. eczema. 
Triamcinolone cream was started and rash improved. 
.
# C Diff Colitis: Patient was recently admitted for C. diff 
colitis with sepsis. Repeat C Diff PCR was negative during last 
hospitalization. She completed her PO vancomycin course on 
___. Her PO vancomycin was continued during hospitalization 
because of concurrent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics 
(zosyn) for pseudomonas UTI. Her zosyn was completed on ___, 
should continued PO vanco until ___. 
.
# Anemia: Patient with guaiac positive stools during last 
admission, new from past admission. Hct stable ___ high ___ 
throughout hospitalization; she did receive one unit pRBC for 
colloid pressure support.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.
.
# GERD: Patient previously on omeprazole last hospitalization, 
which was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was 
transitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis which was held ___ 
setting of delirium. Famotidine was restarted at 20mg BID once 
she was no longer delirious. 

# EKG Changes: Patient had lateral STE and mildly elevated 
troponin x3 (CK/MB flat)on admission, felt likely due to blunt 
injury ___ compressions ___ ED vs. demand ischemia. 
.
# A-line: patient had femoral A-line placed ___ ED ___ setting of 
her hypotension. This was discontinued ___ ICU and replaced with 
PICC. She had one set of BCx which grew Lactobacillus, likely 
skin contaminant. Other surveillance cx negative. 
.
