Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ with a history of CAD, PVD, and 
COPD and history of recurrent chest pain who presented with afib 
with RVR and COPD exacerbation. 
  
ACUTE PROBLEMS:

#COPD exacerbation: Ms. ___ had had two recent ED visits 
for COPD exacerbation, most recently ___ when she was started 
on prednisone 60 mg. She presented to her PCP's office with 
worsening dyspnea despite this therapy and was also complaining 
of nasal congestion, suggesting a viral URI trigger. In clinic 
she was also noted to be in afib with RVR so was referred to the 
ED where she was admitted after control of her heart rate (see 
below). On admission to the floor, she was noted to have 
wheezing, increased work of breathing, and poor air movement. 
She was treated with 125 mg solumedrol and maintained on 60 mg 
PO prednisone daily. Her home theophylline was decreased from 
400 mg BID to ___ mg BID due to concerns it was contributing to 
her tachyarrhythmia. She was placed on ipratropium nebs q6h, 
albuterol nebs q2h, and fluticasone-salmeterol. Pulmonary was 
consulted and recommended a trial of diuresis so she received 10 
mg IV Lasix as well. Azithromycin was not given due to concerns 
for QT prolongation with theophylline and amiodarone (QTc was 
460). She was started on a 5 day course of ceftriaxone instead, 
and discharged to finish the course with cefpodoxime. She was 
discharged with a prednisone taper (10 mg decrease q3d until at 
10 mg, then stay at 10 mg until pulm follow up) as well as 
follow up with pulmonary rehab and a pulmonologist she 
previously followed with, Dr. ___. She was also discharged on 
2L supplemental O2 to be worn at all times. 

#Atrial fibrillation: Ms. ___ has known atrial 
fibrillation for which she was on amiodarone and apixaban but 
was found to have HR in the 120s in her PCP's office, prompting 
her referral to the ED. Her COPD exacerbation was the likely 
precipitant, with medications also possibly contributing, 
particularly theophylline. She was started on a diltiazem gtt in 
the ED to control her rates than transitioned to diltiazem 90 mg 
q6h. After arrival to the floor, her rates remained controlled. 
Her amiodarone and apixaban were continued. Her theophylline was 
decreased to 200 mg BID from 400 mg BID.

#Iron deficiency anemia. Patient was found to have microcytic 
anemia with low iron and ferritin. She was started on IV iron 
125 mg ferric gluconate x4 doses and wasdischarged on PO iron 
with a bowel regimen. Her H/H was stable throughout the 
hospitalized; there was no evidence of bleeding.

Transitional issues:
- patient discharged on prednisone taper: decrease by 10 mg 
every 3 days until at 10 mg, then keep at 10 mg until seen by 
pulmonology
- patient discharged with plan to follow up with pulmonology and 
pulmonary rehab. Can call ___ to schedule appointment 
with pulmonary rehab.
- patient discharged on with 2 days of cefpodoxime to complete 5 
day course of antibiotics for severe COPD exacerbation
- patient discharged with O2 concentrator for continuous home O2
- patient's theophylline decreased from 300 mg BID to ___ mg BID 
due to her afib with RVR; may want to consider further 
theophylline wean, and addition of azithromycin (if QTc is 
decreased as patient also on amiodarone), and/or roflumilast 
therapy
- patient found to be iron deficient, started on IV iron 
repletion, discharged on PO iron
- patient found to have elevated TSH, please follow up free T4 
which was pending on discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized at ___ 
because you were having difficulty breathing and were found in 
clinic to have a fast heart rate. Your difficulty breathing was 
due to your COPD flaring. Your fast heart rate was due to your 
atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rate that can 
sometimes cause the heart to beat very quickly. Medications that 
you were taking, such as theophylline, were likely contributing. 
Your heart rate was lowered using the same medication that you 
take at home, diltiazem, given through your IV. 

Your COPD was likely worsened because of a cold. However, your 
flare was very serious requiring IV steroids and many inhaled 
treatments. You should follow up with the lung doctors as ___ 
as with pulmonary rehab to make sure your lung disease is being 
treated as well as possible to prevent you from coming into the 
hospital as often. Please call ___ to schedule an 
appointment with them.

It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you all 
the best in the future.

Sincerely,

Your ___ team
