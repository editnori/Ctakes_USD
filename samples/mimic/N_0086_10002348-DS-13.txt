Brief Hospital Course:
#Brain lesion
Patient was found to have cerebellar hypodensity on NCHCT from 
OSH. CT w/wo contrast was obtained while in the ED at ___ 
which was concerning for underlying mass lesion and 
hydrocephalus. (Of note, she was unable to get MRI due to 
reportedly having a non-compatible aneurysm clip that was placed 
in ___ at ___. Patient was admitted to the ___ for close 
monitoring and surgical planning. She was started on 
dexamethasone 4mg Q6hr for mass effect. CT torso was obtained 
which showed two lung nodules, see below for more information. 
Neuro and radiation oncology were consulted. Plan was made for 
surgical resection of the lesion. On ___, it was determined 
that her aneurysm clip was MRI compatible and she was able to 
have a MRI Brain for surgical planning. She went to the OR the 
evening of ___ for a suboccipital craniotomy for resection of 
her cerebellar lesion. Postoperatively she was monitored in 
Neuro ICU, where she remained neurologically and hemodynamically 
stable. She was transferred to the ___ on POD#2 and made floor 
status. Her Dexamethasone was ordered to taper down to a 
maintenance dose of 2mg BID over the course of one week. Her 
pathology finalized as small cell lung carcinoma. 

#Lung lesions
CT torso was obtained which showed two lung nodules, one in the 
left paramedian abutting the aortic arch and the other in the 
right upper lobe. Pulmonary was consulted and stated that no 
further intervention was indicated until final pathology was 
back. Heme-Onc was also consulted, and made recommendations that 
no further lung imaging or separate lung biopsy was needed. Both 
Pulmonary and Heme-Onc stated that staging and treatment could 
be determined based on the tissue pathology from resection of 
the brain lesion. Her final pathology came back as small cell 
lung carcinoma. She will follow-up with the thoracic oncologist 
on ___. 

#Steroid-induced hyperglycemia
Throughout her admission, the patient intermittently required 
sliding scale Insulin for elevated blood sugars while on 
Dexamethasone. She was evaluated by the ___ inpatient team on 
___, who decided that she did not need to go home on Insulin. 
They recommended discharging her with a glucometer so that she 
could check her blood sugars daily with a goal blood sugar less 
than 200. She was advised to record her readings and follow-up 
with her PCP and ___. 

#Bradycardia
She was due to transfer out to the ___ on POD1, however was 
kept in the ICU for asymptomatic bradycardia to the ___. She

dipped to the ___, however remained asymptomatic.

#Bell's palsy
The patient was resumed on her home Valacyclovir and Prenisolone 
gtts. 

#Urinary urgency
On POD 2, the patient complained of urinary urgency and 
increased frequency. U/A was negative and culture was negative.
