Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with history of provoked 
DVT/PE (on lovenox), bladder cancer s/p Robotic TAH-BSO, lap 
radical cystectomy with ileal loop diversion and anterior 
vaginectomy in ___ c/b abdominal fluid requiring 
placement of drainage catheters, and recent hydronephrosis 
requiring placement of bilateral PCN tubes on ___, presenting 
from rehab with hematuria and weakness.

On arrival, pt had evidence of frank hematuria in her urostomy 
bag and PCN tubes. Her hemoglobin was initially 8.1, which 
subsequently dropped to 7.0 Her lovenox was held, and she was 
transfused with 1 U PRBC with an appropriate hemoglobin bump to 
8.2. Hematuria was likely caused by recent instrumentation in 
the setting of anticoagulation. Her hematuria improved, as did 
her dizziness/weakness. ___ was consulted and recommending 
capping her PCN tubes. After discussion with the patient's 
hematologist, it was decided to stop her lovenox treatment given 
that her DVT/PE were provoked in the setting of her recovery 
from surgery, and that she had received almost 6 months of 
treatment.

Secondary Issues:

# Asymptomatic bacteruria: Patient with asymptomatic bacteruria 
in setting of recent procedural manipulation. She was afebrile 
and without leukocytosis, so treatment with antibiotics was 
deferred.

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin 10 mg daily

# Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine 175 mcg daily
