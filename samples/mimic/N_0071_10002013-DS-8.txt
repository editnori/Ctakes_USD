History of Present Illness:
___ w/ PMH of CAD s/p PCI x3, s/p off-pump CABG x3 ___ 
(___-->LAD, SVG -->diag, OM), type 2 DM on insulin, HTN, 
hyperlipidemia presents with a 3 day history of ___ sharp, 
left-sided chest pain and SOB. She describes the chest pain as 
"pinching all the way down to the bone." She endorses ___ 
episodes of pain/day, always at rest. The episodes of pain last 
approximately 5 minutes and are relieved by nitroglycerin. Her 
pain is not worsened by exertion or eating. She described her 
symptoms to her PCP over the phone, who told her to come to the 
ED. She says they feel similar to her MI in the past. She also 
endorsed vomiting last night. She denies any diaphoresis. She 
also endorses a cough.  
The patient has developed increased shortness of breath over the 
past few days. She has experienced orthopnea for the past few 
years, but denies PND and lower extremity edema. On exam in the 
ED she was tachycardic, in a regular rhythm. Lungs were CTAB. 
She had trace edema in her left lower extremity, none in her 
right leg.  
 
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.8 111 177/86 18 97%. Labs and 
imaging significant for a CXR with new moderate left pleural 
effusion with adjacent atelectasis in the left lung base, CBC 
within normal limits, electrolytes within normal limits, Cr. 
1.2, troponin 0.08 and D-dimer 2350. A CT of the chest was 
performed, which showed no CT evidence for pulmonary embolus, 
but small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  
Patient given aspirin 81mg x 4, SL nitroglycerin x 1 and heparin 
bolus.  
Vitals on transfer were 99.2 112 162/82 22 98% RA  
On arrival to the floor, patient is AAOx3, and comfortable.

Imaging/studies:
EKG on admission- Sinus tachycardia. Extensive ST segment 
changes may be due to ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing 
no change.  

CXR ___- New moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent 
atelectasis in the left lung base. 
  
CTA Chest ___.  No CT evidence for pulmonary embolus. 
2.  Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  
3.  Possible calcified splenic artery aneurysm in the region of 
the hilum. 

Cardiac catheterization ___. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary disease in the native vessels.  
The ___ 
had no angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD had a 70% 
lesion in a 
prior stent, and a jailed diagnoal which was small and had poor 
flow. 
The LCx had a 70-80% stenosis at its origin.  The RCA had no 
angiographically apparent disease. 
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated the LIMA graft to 
be 
patent. 
3. Venous conduit angiography demonstrated a patent SVG to OM 
with 
retrograde stenosis involving a small sub-branch of the OM.  The 
SVG to 
small diagonal was presumed occluded and unable to be 
identified. 
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic hypertension 
with 
aortic pressure of 184/105 mm Hg. 
  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease in the native arteries 
2. Patent LIMA to LAD, patent SVG to OM, occluded SVG to small 
diagonal 
branch. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with a history of CAD s/p PCI x3, s/p CABG x3 
(___), type 2 DM on insulin, HTN, and HLD who presented with 
a 3 day history of left sided chest pain and SOB.  

# Chest Pain- Patient with significant CAD history, s/p recent 
CABG, presenting with chest pain and rising troponins, with new 
ST depressions inferiorly in V4-V6, consistent with NSTEMI.  
Patient's troponins plateaued at 0.13.  She has initiated on a 
heparin gtt in the ED, and was taken to cardiac cath the 
following morning.  Catheterization showed occlusion of the SVG 
to the diagonal, possibly causing her current symptoms.  No 
intervention was performed.  Patient was medically optimized 
with increased metoprolol, initiation of losartan, and 
initiation of imdur.  Other potential causes of her chest pain 
were considered including PE (ruled out with negative CTA), 
pericarditis (symptoms consistent, but exam and EKG not 
consistent, also patient has been essentially treated as she has 
been taking consistent NSAIDs), costochondritis (symptoms 
intermittently reproducible on exam), or pleuritis secondary to 
pleural effusion (very small effusion, stable since CABG).  
   If pain persists, patient was instructed to speak with her 
cardiologist about increasing imdur should her blood pressure 
tolerate.  
  
# Acute renal insufficiency- On admission, creatinine elevated 
to 1.2, likely due to dehydration, as creatinine improved 
overnight with gentle fluids and remained stable. 

# COPD- Continued on home inhalers (albuterol, fluticasone)

# DM- Continued with glargine 50 units Q6 and ISS  

# HLD- Continued on home atorvastatin 

# GERD- Continued on home pantoprazole

# Transitional issues-
- NEW MEDICATIONS- losartan and imdur
- MEDICATION CHANGES- metoprolol increased to 50mg po TID (from 
25 TID)
- if ongoing chest pain, consider titrating up on imdur if c/w 
anginal pain.   Also may consider treating for costochondritis 
and pericarditis

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
admission to ___.

You were admitted with chest pain/pressure concerning for a 
heart attack.  A cardiac catheterization showed that one of your 
grafts from your recent cardiac bypass surgery is clotted and no 
longer working, potentially causing your symptoms.  

We have increased and added medications to control your 
symptoms.  The changes are below:
START losartan
START isosorbide mononitrate
INCREASE atorvastatin
INCREASE metoprolol
DECREASE aspirin
DECREASE pantoprazole
STOP ibuprofen (you were taking too much. take tylenol ___ for 
pain)

Once you leave the hospital, we recommend further workup of a 
fluid collection seen around your left lung and better 
management of your diabetes with the help of your PCP.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
