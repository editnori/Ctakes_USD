Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old Male who presented on ___ for 
a planned minimally invasive and possibly open radical distal 
gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy for locally advanced gastric 
carcinoma after chemotherapy. After placement of the Right upper 
quadrant port, insufflation revealed the right upper quadrant 
port to be penetrating the omentum. It appeared to miss the 
transverse mesocolon as well as the colon itself. During the 
surgery, there were visually obvious peritoneal deposits on all 
peritoneal surfaces in all four quadrants, which demonstrated 
undetected carcinomatosis, poorly -differentiated adenocarcinoma 
involving the peritoneum. For this reason, the procedure was 
then aborted. Post-operatively the patient was taken to the PACU 
until stable and then transferred to the wards until stable to 
go home. 

#NEURO: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with dilaudid PCA 
which he was not using and then transitioned to tramadol which 
he got only one dose. Pain was very well controlled.

#CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.  

#PULMONARY: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.  

#GI/GU/FEN: Before the procedure started, OR nurse was unable to 
pass Foley after attempt with standard and coude type. PA 
___, with usual sterile technique, re-attempted foley 
placement after 10cc urojet application with ___ and ___ 
coude-type catheters but was also unable to get passed the 
prostate. Urology was consulted and they performed a flexible 
cystoscope demonstrating a normal urethra. Using a flexible 
guidewire, cystoscope was advanced into the bladder. The scope 
was withdrawn and a ___ council was advanced over the wire, 
passed the prostate and into the bladder. The patient was 
discharged with the Foley in place with instructions to 
follow-up with urology as outpatient in 5 to 7 days for a 
voiding trial. No antibiotics were administered. The patient was 
tolerating a regular diet prior to discharge. 

#ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs 
of infection, of which there were none.  

#HEME: Patient received BID SQH for DVT prophylaxis, in addition 
to encouraging early ambulation and Venodyne compression 
devices. On POD1 the patient was restarted on his home 
enoxaparin before discharge.

#TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
--------------------

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating diet as 
above per oral, ambulating, and pain was well controlled. The 
patient was discharged home with the Foley catheter with 
appropriate teaching for care. The patient received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
gastric cancer. You had an attempted Robot-assisted laparoscopic 
partial gastrectomy and gastroscopy on ___ without 
complications. You tolerated the procedure well and are 
ambulating, stooling, tolerating a regular diet, and your pain 
is controlled by pain medications by mouth. You are now ready to 
be discharged to home. Please follow the recommendations below 
to ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 
- You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 
otherwise.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for **oxycodone 
for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 
to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)
-any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you

Additional: 
*- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest 
or back
*- urinary:  burning or blood in your urine or the inability to 
urinate

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
- dressing removal:
- You may remove your dressings tomorrow ___ and shower that 
same day with any bandage strips that may be covering your 
wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off.
 Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. 

Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for 
allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a 
quick return to your usual life and activities.

Home with ___:
You had a Foley catheter in your bladder placed by urology on 
the day of your surgery after difficulty trying to place it.
You will keep the catheter until your appointment with Urology 
in 5 days (please call the number below to schedule your 
appointment), who will decide if you need it longer or attempt 
to remove it and see if you are able to void.
 Empty the bag as needed and as shown to you by nursing staff. 
You will be given a leg bag before your discharge, that you may 
use for short trips. This is a smaller bag that straps to your 
leg, to take home and wear if you are traveling outside your 
home. This holds a smaller amount than the bag you have now, so 
it needs to be emptied more often. Some people find it easier to 
use the larger bad when they are at home or carry it with them.
