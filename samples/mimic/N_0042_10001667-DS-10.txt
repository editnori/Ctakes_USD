History of Present Illness:
___ year old right-handed woman with hx of Atrial fibrillation on 
Eliquis (only once daily), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF
presents as transfer from OSH after she had acute onset 
dysarthria and CTA showed possible partial thrombus or stenosis 
in superior division of L MCA. Transferred here for closer 
monitoring and possible thrombectomy if her exam acutely 
worsens.

History obtained from patient and daughter at bedside. Patient 
is an excellent historian. 

On ___, she had dinner with friends and then returned to her 
apartment and was fooling around on her computer. Last known 
well
was around 8:00 ___. Then, she had an odd sensation and started 
throwing her arms around. She went to living room to sit down 
and
tried to read but could not see the words very clearly. Then, 
two family members were knocking at the door and she had a tough 
time
standing up to open door. She was able to eventually stand up 
with great difficulty and walked with her walker. She usually 
walks with a walker because of knee replacement. Finally, got up 
out of chair with walker and walked to the door to unlock. She 
noticed problems talking to family members. She had difficulty 
forming words and pronouncing words. Denies word finding 
difficulty. She could tell it was slurred like a person who had 
too much to drink. EMTs asked if she was intoxicated but she was 
not. She was very aware of her dysarthria and told her daughters 
that she thinks she's having a stroke. Then, she said she had 
trouble sitting down but has no idea why she thought that. When 
she was standing, she was able to walk with walker but she felt 
unsteady and almost fell. No visual changes. No numbness or 
tingling. Denies focal weakness; she just had trouble standing 
up. She was able to unlock her door without issue but she felt 
shaky. 

She was brought by EMS to ___ where NIHSS was 1 for 
slurred speech. There, she felt the same but her symptoms 
started to improve when she started to be transferred. 
Paramedics said her speech was improving rapidly en route.  

Last month, started needing naps. Her hearing is poor at 
baseline and she normally uses hearing aids. 

For the past ___ months, she has had ___ nocturia nightly. No 
dysuria. 

She has noticed more frequent headaches lately in the past ___ 
months. Last headache was yesterday. She takes tramadol and 
acetaminophen up to a couple times a night. She reports 
headaches at night which wake her up. She denies that the 
headache is
positional; it is the same sitting up or lying down. She has had 
some gradual weight loss over the past ~12 months; ___ year ago 
she was almost 140 lbs, and now she is ___ lbs. Her appetite is 
still good and she enjoys eating but she is less hungry that she 
used to be.  

Daughter says that she has had marked decline in memory in past 
___ weeks. Over past few years, she has been forgetting plans, 
times for pickpup, and dinner plans, which has become normal. 
Over the past ___ weeks, family has noticed dramatic worsening. 
She doesn't remember which grandkids were coming to visit when 
she bought the plane tickets herself.

She endorses 2 pillow orthopnea.

___ OSH CTA head/neck ___ opinion (___)
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Segmental left vertebral artery occlusion of indeterminate 
chronicity.  No evidence of ischemia.
2.  Somewhat small caliber attenuated left M2 inferior branch, 
without evidence of focal occlusion.
3.  No acute intracranial abnormality on noncontrast CT head.

___ MRI head w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.  Specifically, no large 
territory infarction or hemorrhage.
2. Scattered foci of T2/high-signal intensity in the subcortical 
and periventricular white matter are nonspecific and may reflect 
changes due to chronic small vessel disease.

___ TTE
IMPRESSION: No structural source of thromboembolism identified 
(underlying rhythm predisposes to thrombus formation). Preserved 
left ventricular systolic function in the setting of 
beat-to-beat variability due to arrhythmia. Mild to moderate 
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Normal pulmonary pressure. 
Very small pericardial effusion
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with AFib on Eliquis, CHF, 
HLD, HTN who presented w/ sudden onset dysarthria, abnormal arm 
movements, and poor balance (walker at baseline). NIHSS 1 for 
slurred speech at OSH. There, a CTA head and neck was completed, 
and there was concern for left M2 branch attenuation concerning 
for stenosis or occlusion, and she was subsequently transferred 
for consideration of thrombectomy but NIHSS 0 on arrival so she 
was not deemed a candidate. She was admitted to the Neurology 
stroke service for further evaluation of possible TIA vs stroke. 
No further symptoms noted during admission. MRI head w/o 
contrast were without evidence of stroke. Reports recent 
echocardiogram per outpatient PCP/cardiologist, reported as no 
acute findings and so this was not repeated. She mentioned 
concern about worsening memory, but able to perform ADLs w/ 
meals/cleaning provided by ALF (moved 10 months ago); it appears 
there has been no acute change. She was taking apixiban 2.5mg 
once daily (unclear why as this is a BID medication), and so her 
dose was increased to 2.5mg BID (she was not a candidate for 5mg 
BID due to her age and weight). She was started on atorvastatin 
for her hyperlipidemia (LDL 126). EP cardiology was consulted 
for frequent sinus pauses noted on telemetry that persisted 
despite holding home atenolol, recommending discontinuing home 
digoxin and close cardiology ___. Discharged to home w/ 
___ & ___ and close PCP ___.

#Transient slurred speech and instability, c/f TIA
- ___ consult - cleared for home with home services
- Started on atorvastatin for HLD and increased home apixaban to 
therapeutic level
- ___ with stroke neurology after discharge

Her stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c 5.5%
2) Likely chronic segmental left vertebral artery occlusion and 
somewhat small caliber attenuated left M2 inferior branch
3) Hyperlipidemia: LDL 126
4) Obesity
5) No concern noted for sleep apnea - she does not carry the 
diagnosis
An echocardiogram did not show a PFO on bubble study.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of slurred speech due to 
concern for an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood 
vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by 
a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms. However, the MRI of your brain did not show 
evidence of stroke or TIA. Your symptoms could have been related 
to blood pressure, dehydration, alcohol use, or a combination of 
these factors.

We are changing your medications as follows:
Increase apixaban to 2.5mg twice daily
Start Vitamin B12 daily supplement

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with your primary care physician as listed 
below. You should also follow up with your cardiologist as you 
were noted to have occasional pauses on cardiac monitoring.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, please pay attention to 
the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
