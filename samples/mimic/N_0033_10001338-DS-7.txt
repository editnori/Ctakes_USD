(non-bloody, non-biliary).  The nausea is associated with a

Abdomen soft, round, non-tender, non-distended with 6cm of open 
transverse incision through the subcutis with intact deep 
fascia; no erythema or induration; minimal serous output.  
___ without edema, 2+ DP pulses
 
Pertinent Results:
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  ___ 6:___BDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o abscess-NO IV contrast, PO only 
Field of view: 40

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with h/o divertic s/p colectomy here with 
elevated WBC and nausea 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o abscess-NO IV contrast, PO only 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: RF

INDICATION: ___ woman with elevated white blood cell 
count and nausea, history of recent colectomy for recurrent 
diverticulitis.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis of ___.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the 
abdomen and pelvis after the administration of oral contrast. No 
intravenous contrast was administered. Multiplanar reformatted 
images were also obtained.

FINDINGS: 

The lung bases are clear. A 4-mm calcified granuloma in the 
right lung base is unchanged. Limited images of the heart are 
unremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion.

In the abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, adrenal 
glands, pancreas, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small 
and large bowel are unremarkable. There is no mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid or free air in the 
abdomen. Immediately adjacent to the left common iliac artery, 
is a linear focus of hyper-attenuating material, with the 
appearance of suture material, largely unchanged from the prior 
examination.

In the pelvis, suture material is seen in the distal sigmoid 
colon, unchanged in appearance from prior examination and 
consistent with colonic anastomosis. There is no evidence of 
stricture or obstruction at this site. There is no local fluid 
collection to indicate abscess. There are no signs of 
inflammation. The intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are 
unremarkable, containing air and stool in a normal pattern 
without bowel dilatation. The appendix is visualized and is 
normal. The urinary bladder, uterus, and adnexa are 
unremarkable. There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in 
the pelvis. A fat-containing left inguinal hernia is unchanged.

Examination of soft tissues reveals stranding and subcutaneous 
air of the soft tissues along the midline lower anterior 
abdominal wall, slightly larger in size than on the prior 
examination of approximately 2 weeks ago. Additionally, a small 
focus of fluid attenuating material now extends from the 
abdominal wall musculature through the subcutaneous tissues, and 
appears to drain into an external collecting device. No discrete 
fluid collection is identified to indicate abscess formation, or 
that would be amenable to drainage. However, this appearance 
suggests continued cellulitis.

Examination of osseous structures reveals mild degenerative 
disease at L5-S1 and are otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of sigmoid colon anastomosis without 
obstruction or abscess formation.
2. Stranding and subcutaneous air along the lower abdominal wall 
in the midline, indicating cellulitis, but without discrete or 
drainable fluid collection

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
GI: Admitted in early morning on ___ the pt was made NPO with 
IVF resuscitation.  A abdominal/pelvic CT was done and 
demonstrated a stable sigmoid anastomosis without any fluid 
collections or free air.  Over the first night her urine output 
increased and a foley was not placed.  Due to her constant loose 
stools, toxin screens of C.diff were sent and returned negative. 
 By HD2, the nausea persisted an a GI consult was obtained.  The 
GI service believed the nausea to be related to baseline reflux 
exacerbated by her postop course, including a wound infection.  
Per their recommendations, she was started on an antacid and 
upon discharge she will follow up with a gastroenterologist to 
determine her H.pylori status.   Prior to discharge, she was 
tolerating a low residue diet and able to hydrate herself.
