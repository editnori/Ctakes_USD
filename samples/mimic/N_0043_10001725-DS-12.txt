PERTINENT IMAGING:

None

PERTINENT MICRO:

None
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F w/ Hx of cervical CA s/p radical 
hysterectomy c/b chronic ___ lymphedema and urinary retention, 
Asthma, GERD, anxiety/depression, fibromyalgia. Please refer to 
the operative report for full details.

Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately 
post-op, her pain was controlled with IV dilaudid and toradol. 
However, in the PACU, the patient started feeling itchy.  Once 
the pt returned to the floor, she noted sensation of tongue / 
lip swelling, difficulty swallowing secretions, and a change in 
her voice.  No SOB, no flushing, no stridor or wheeze.  She was 
administered an Epi-pen, Solumedrol 100 mg IV, Famotidine 20 mg 
IV, and Hydroxyzine 25 mg IM.  She was transferred to the MICU 
for closer monitoring. 

The patient has numerous drug allergies and was administered the 
following medications intra-operatively: Midazolam, Rocuronium, 
Fentanyl, Dexamethasone, Hydromorphone, Ondansetron, Lidocaine, 
Propofol, Cefazolin, Glycopyrrolate, Phenylephrine, and 
Ketorolac.

In the MICU, initial VS were HR 87, BP 100/63, RR 17, S 100% 
___.  The patient was in NAD, without wheeze or poor air 
movement on exam, but complained of persistent voice change and 
difficulty swallowing, for which she required 2 more epi pens.  
Has remained hemodynamically stable and without respiratory 
compromise.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

*) Post operative care
Her pain was controlled immediately post-op with IV dilaudid and 
toradol. This was transitioned to po oxycodone as it was 
difficult to determine what was causing an allergic reaction in 
Ms. ___.

Her vaginal packing was removed on POD 1, on post-operative day 
2, her urine output was adequate and her Foley was removed. The 
patient was able to void spontaneously, but did require 
self-catheterization ___ times a day based on a sensation of 
bladder fullness. 

*) Anaphylaxis: 
In the PACU the patient awoke and started feeling pruritis. Once 
she arrived to the floor, the patient noted difficulty talking, 
subjectively swollen lips/tongue, and vocal changes. No SOB, no 
flushing, no stridor or wheeze. A trigger was called for 
anaphyllaxis and she recieved an Epi-pen, Solumedrol 100 mg IV, 
Famotidine 20 mg IV, and Hydroxyzine 25 mg IM.  She was 
transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. 

In the MICU, initial VS were HR 87, BP 100/63, RR 17, S 100% 
___.  The patient was in NAD, without wheeze or poor air 
movement on exam, but complained of persistent voice change and 
difficulty swallowing, for which she required 2 more epi pens.  
Has remained hemodynamically stable and without respiratory 
compromise. 

Of note, patient was lying comfortable in bed around 2200 and 
continuing to inquire about more Epi-pens vs epinephrine gtt 
despite comfortable respiration, vocalization, non-edematous 
oral structures. She also perseverated about her Ativan and 
Ambien, as well as her propranolol for essential tremor despite 
explanation that beta blockers can worsen bronchoconstriction 
and respiratory compromise in anaphylaxis.

On the day she was called out to the floor, the pt complained of 
persistent facial flushing.  She was afebrile, hemodynamically 
stable, and without respiratory compromise or systemic symptoms. 
 Symptomatic care with hydroxyzine and eucerin lotion was 
provided.

Upon step down to the floor, the patient again reported to 
nursing that she felt throat constriction. Epinephrine and 
solumedrol were given and the patient felt relief. Allergy was 
consulted, and they asked us to stop all new medications given 
to her while at the hospital, and to report all of them as 
allergies. In addition, we sent out a tryptase level, as well as 
coordinated outpatient follow-up with them. 

#Chronic ___ edema: Continue home Metolazone, spironolactone, 
potassium repletion as not hypotensive.  We monitored her K 
during her stay, which was WNL.

#Asthma: Home Albuterol use ___ per week, did not require in 
the MICU. 

#GERD: Nexium (was initially held on admission, but per pt 
request was given on ___ prior to advancing diet)

#ADHD: On Adderall, held on admission

# Anxiety/depression/fibromyalgia: lorazepam 

# Insomnia: zolpidem

By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was the  discharged home in stable condition 
with outpatient follow-up scheduled. She was also scheduled to 
have an appointment with Allergy and Immunology.
