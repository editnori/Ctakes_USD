SELECT IMAGING:
===============
___ CXR:  
COMPARISON: ___  
FINDINGS:  
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. There is mild unfolding of the 
thoracic aorta. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours 
are otherwise unremarkable. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without 
effusion or pneumothorax. Focus of air seen under the right 
hemidiaphragm, likely represents colonic interposition.  
IMPRESSION:No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  

___ RUE U/S:
 IMPRESSION: 4 cm acute deep vein thrombosis noted within the 
mid right brachial vein as detailed above. 

___ CXR:
 IMPRESSION: The endotracheal tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube tip is beyond the GE junction and off the edge 
of the film.  A left central line is present in the tip is in 
the mid SVC.  A pacemaker is noted on the right in the lead 
projects over the right ventricle.  There is probable scarring 
in both lung apices.  There are no new areas of consolidation.  
There is upper zone redistribution and cardiomegaly suggesting 
pulmonary venous hypertension. There is no pneumothorax. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx severe COPD, AFib, CAD, HTN, HLD, recent hospitalizations 
for recurrent COPD exacerbations over the last several months, 
who presented with dyspnea and increased wheezing secondary to 
severe COPD. 

She was treated for her COPD with nebulizers and steroids, but 
continued to decline eventually suffering a PEA arrest thought 
due to hypoxemia requiring endotracheal intubation and 
mechanical ventilation. A temporary pacemaker was placed for 
periods of bradycardia that may also have contributed to her PEA 
arrest (versus being a manifestation of severe hypoxemia/severe 
hypercarbia preceding her arrest). She made a cognitive recovery 
but was unable to be successfully weaned from her ventilator. 
She had capacity and was able to make it understand that she did 
not wish: continued intubation & mechanical ventilation; 
re-intubation and mechanical ventilation once extubated; or, 
positive non-invasive pressure ventilation. After extensive 
discussions with her and her family, she was transitioned to 
DNR/DNI and comfort-oriented care. She was extubated to spend 
quality time with her family before passing from respiratory 
failure on the morning of ___ at 0515. Autopsy was declined 
by family.

She was incidentally found to have a RUE DVT that was treated 
with heparin gtt (which was also used for anticoagulation for 
her atrial fibrillation; she was temporarily transitioned to 
argatroban for concern of HIT, but PF4 antibodies returned at 
very low OD, making this diagnosis unlikely). She was also 
treated for an acute sinusitis with Augmentin during her 
hospital stay.
