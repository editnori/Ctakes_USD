Brief Hospital Course:
=============
SUMMARY
=============

___ yo F with hx of DMII, HTN who presented with diabetic foot 
ulcer on her left hallux complicated by osteomyelitis. She 
underwent surgical debridement and partial tissue and bone 
removal on ___. However the infection persisted, and she 
underwent left hallux amputation on ___. She was started 
on IV nafcillin for MSSA infection with plan to continue home 
infusions of nafcillin until at least ___

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
#Osteomyelitis of left hallux: Due to diabetic ulcer of left 
hallux. Patient underwent partial left hallux amputation on ___ 
by podiatry. She was initially placed on IV Vancomycin, Flagyl, 
and cefepime. Initial surgical cultures came back positive for 
MSSA, so was changed to IV nafcillin. Patient continued to be 
afebrile, but her left foot continued to have erythema, edema, 
pain, and the ulcer was not healing well. There was concern for 
poor arterial blood flow and therefore underwent noninvasive 
arterial studies on bilateral lower extremities. The studies 
showed mild atherosclerotic disease in her left leg and foot, 
and severe atherosclerotic disease in her right leg and foot. 
Vascular surgery was consulted for potential intervention, but 
they felt that no further vascular intervention was warranted 
prior to podiatric surgery. The patient was brought back to the 
OR by podiatry on ___ for total left hallux amputation 
given lack of clinical improvement. Her ___ blood cell count 
continued to down trend. The pathology report showed clean 
margins. However, patient was continuing to have pain, and there 
was increased erythema and swelling around surgical site. An MRI 
of the left foot was done, which showed devitalization of the 
surgical flap, some edema, and a hyperintense focal spot at the 
site of the surgery. There were no signs of abscess or fluid 
collection. Podiatry team felt patient did not need any acute 
surgical intervention and will have close follow-up on 
___. A PICC line was placed in the right arm 
___ with tentative plan to complete a two-week course of IV 
nafcillin on ___. For the wound, podiatry recommends daily 
dressing changes to left foot surgical site: Betadine moistened 
gauze, 4x4 gauze, and kerlix.

#Cough: During her stay the patient developed cough that was 
nonproductive. It was thought to be due to atelectasis after 
surgery, especially since her rales on exam would clear with 
coughing. A repeat chest x-ray was negative for any acute 
cardiopulmonary processes and on comparison to previous chest 
x-ray during this hospital stay there were no changes. Will 
restart home Lasix at discharge.

#Hypertension: Patient's antihypertensives were held upon 
admission given that her blood pressures were low with systolic 
blood pressures in the ___ likely due to sepsis in the 
setting of her osteomyelitis from her diabetic foot ulcer. After 
her first debridement, patient's blood pressures increase to 
160s-170s so we restarted her losartan and furosemide. However 
her blood pressure dipped back down again to the ___ systolic 
and her creatinine bumped up to 1.8 so we discontinued her 
losartan and furosemide. Her metoprolol was continued with 
holding parameters, and it was held when her systolic blood 
pressure was less than 110. Her ___ resolved, and she became 
hypertensive again, so we restarted her losartan while in the 
hospital and instructed the patient to restart her Lasix upon 
discharge from the hospital.

#Acute Kidney Injury: Her baseline creatinine is 1.0. It bumped 
up to 1.8 in the setting of sepsis, restarting her losartan and 
furosemide, and hypotension. We gave her IV fluids and stopped 
her losartan and furosemide. Her creatinine continued to improve 
with these measures and upon discharge it was 1.1-1.2, which is 
around her baseline.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Upon admission, patient was started 
on 80% of home insulin doses. Her Lantus inpatient dose was 32 
units, and her Humalog inpatient dose was 12 units 3 times 
daily. Patient's blood sugars were hard to control while she was 
inpatient. Working with the ___ diabetes consult team we 
adjusted her insulin doses as needed. ___ recommended 
discharging the patient on 48 units of Toujeo and 18 units of 
Novolog with meals as well as resuming her Trajenta and 
Jardiance.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Patient is on oxycodone 5 mg Q8H for her foot pain from the 
surgery. She was given enough to get her to her PCP appointment, 
which is ___. Please re-assess pain management.

[ ] Osteomyelitis, infected diabetic foot ulcer: Surgical margin 
from total left hallux amputation on ___ was negative for 
osteomyelitis. Patient to complete a 2 week course of nafcillin 
for ongoing soft tissue infection and will follow up with ID 
prior to completion of antibiotics to ensure resolution. Will be 
discharged on q4 hour nafcillin to be infused via a pump. Once 
finished an antibiotic should also have right arm PICC line 
removed. For the wound, podiatry recommends daily dressing 
changes to left foot surgical site: Betadine moistened gauze, 
4x4 gauze, and kerlix

[ ] Diabetes mellitus type 2: Patient's blood sugars were very 
labile. Given that she came in with a diabetic foot ulcer 
suggesting that her blood sugars are not well-controlled at 
home, she needs close follow-up to optimize her diabetic 
medication regimen. She is being discharged on reduced dose 
Toujeo and regular home Novolog along with her usual Trajenta 
and Jardiance with close follow-up with ___ provider on 
___, ___ at 1 ___. Please reassess patient's need for 
Jardiance given history of recurrent AKIs

[ ] Cough: Patient developed non-productive cough while in 
hospital but afebrile, no leukocytosis, CXR no signs of pleural 
effusion or consolidation. Suspect due to atelectasis in post-op 
period after foot surgery. Will discharge on incentive 
spirometer and restarting home Lasix as outpatient. If not 
improved once back on outpatient Lasix, would consider further 
workup.

[ ] Hypertension: Patient was discharged on her regular home 
medications. While she was an inpatient, she became hypotensive 
when we restarted her on all of her antihypertensives. Please 
follow her blood pressure to ensure that she is on the right 
regimen. If too low, might consider removing furosemide.

[ ] ___: Discharge creatinine 1.2 on ___. Suspect patient will 
have a slight bump in creatinine after restarting losartan on 
___. Patient had weekly labs checked with IV antibiotic 
infusions. If continues to rise, may be due to nafcillin and 
would consider switching antibiotic to cefazolin.
