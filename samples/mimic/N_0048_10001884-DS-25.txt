stress echo which showed inducible ischemia at the achieved 
workload, thought to be single vessel disease per the echo 
report. At that time the plan was for medical management, given

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with 
a recent diagnosis of CAD, HTN and asthma who presents with 
intermittent episodes of chest pain since her recent discharge.  

......................................
Active Issues:
.  
# CORONARIES: patient with intermittent episodes of left chest 
burning, that are not typical of angina since they resolve 
without intervention, are not relieved by nitro and have no 
association with exercise. However, given the findings on her 
recent stress echo of inducible ischemia it is concerning that 
her current symptoms could be related to her underlying CAD. Her 
troponins were negative during this hospital stay.  On this 
admission, she was started on Imdur 30 in addition to the 
medications started on last discharge as it was decided that she 
may need better medical management prior to resorting to PCI 
(which may be a possibility in the future). After administration 
of IMDUR, we walked the patient down the hall, as well as up 
several flights of stairs. She denied feeling short of breath, 
nor did she endorse any other cardiac symtpoms, such as chest 
pain. In fact, she stated that she felt well walking. 
.  
# RHYTHM: LBBB on EKG from yesterday, regular. patient with a 
new diagnosis of MAT on last admission. We continued her on 
Diltiazem. She had several episodes of MAT on tele, but was 
asymptomatic. Given frequent PAT, ___ of Hearts monitor was 
arranged for her on discharge to exclude the possibility that 
symptoms are due to a tachyarrhythmia. 
.............................................
Inactive Issues:
# Hypertension: continued home HCTZ and diltiazem..  
# Asthma:continued home medications.    
# GERD: continued home omeprazole  
.    
CODE: full code  
.....................................  
Transitional Issues:

future if the symtpoms of chest pain return.
