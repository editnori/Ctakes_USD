Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted with sepsis from a urinary tract 
infection after her stent exchange. She was placed empirically 
on vancomycin and cefepime (narrowed to vanc/ceftriaxone on 
HD#1), because of her history of resistant organisms. She 
rapidly improved. Her urine grew E. faecium, sensitive to 
ampicillin. Therefore, a PICC line was placed, and she will 
complete two weeks total of ampicillin for a complicated urinary 
tract infection (additional day days). She will follow up with 
Dr. ___ as an outpatient. She will stop her prophylactic TMP 
while on ampicillin, but then resume after finishing her course.

- follow up with Dr. ___
