Chief Complaint:
Facial weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: ___ RHF w/ hx GERD, mild depression, and prior migraines,
presents now with episode of facial numbness. She had been lying
on her left face, watching TV, and noticed when she got up that
her left face was numb as if she were injected with novacaine, 
in
a distribution that she traces along mid-V2 down to her jaw 
line.
She initially thought it was ___ the way she was lying, but
became concerned when it persisted. She endorsed a mild diffuse
dull HA that is not unusual for her. She states in some ways, it
felt as though a migraine were coming on, though the HA she had
was not typical of her past migraines. The numbness lasted 90
minutes, and has now resolved completely. There was no 
associated
weakness, no sensory changes outside of her face, no VC, 
vertigo,
or language impairment. She cannot recall something like this
happening before, and states that her day was otherwise routine.
On ROS, she notes that about 2 weeks ago she had diarrhea for 1
week which resolved spontaneously. She also endorses feeling
"achey" 4 days ago, otherwise, her health has been normal.

Radiology Report MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
9:44 AM 
1. No acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, there is no 
evidence of 
either acute or previous ischemic event. 
2. Normal cranial and cervical MRA, with no significant mural 
irregularity or 
flow-limiting stenosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with a hx of depression, GERD and 
migraines, presenting with an episode of facial numbness.

1. Facial numbness.  As this episode preceeded a headache, 
suspect likely due to a migraine equivalent, however episode 
could also be due to a TIA in the thalamus.  The patient had an 
MRI, which showed no signs of ischemia, and normal vasculature, 
making migraine equivalent a much more likely diagnosis.  
However, given the possibility of TIA, she has been started on a 
daily aspirin for future stroke prophylaxis.  Exam on discharge 
was notable for mild symmetric hyperreflexia in the lower 
extremities, but otherwise normal neurological exam, with no 
residual sensory deficits.
 
Medications on Admission:
NEXIUM 40 mg--1 capsule(s) by mouth once a day
PROZAC 20 mg--1 capsule(s) by mouth once a day

 
Discharge Medications:
1. Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: One

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Migraine 
 
Discharge Condition:
Mild symmetric hyperreflexia in the lower extremities, otherwise 
normal neurological exam.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for left sided facial numbness.  You had an 
MRI which showed no signs of ischemia.  It is suspected that 
this was related to migraine headaches, but we recommend that 
you start taking a full dose of aspirin.

If you notice new numbness, weakness, worsening headaches, or 
other new concerning symptoms, please return to the nearest ED 
for further evaluation.
 
Followup Instructions:
