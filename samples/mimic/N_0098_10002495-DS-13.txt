Relevant Imaging:
-----------------
TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and 
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= ? 35-40% - assessment 
limited by suboptimal image quality and significant beat to beat 
variability). There is hypokinesis of the mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial 
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior focused study (images reviewed) of 
___, left ventricular systolic function is probably 
similar, although suboptimal image quality of both studies 
precludes definite comparison.  

___ CXR
 
IMPRESSION:  
  
Generalized improvement in both lungs is probably due to 
decrease in pulmonary 
edema, now mild, and decrease in previous moderate right pleural 
effusion.  
There is still substantial consolidation in the right upper lobe 
probably 
pneumonia but the bilateral lower lobe components have improved. 
 Heart size 
top-normal.  No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w/ HTN, HLD, DMII, and old MI transferred 
from ___ w/ NSTEMI w/ diffuse 3 vessel disease s/p DES to 
mid-LAD occlusion found to have severe Cdiff.

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# NSTEMI 
NSTEMI based on STE aVR and V1 but o/w ST depressions w/ 
significant multi vessel disease but significant stenosis in LAD 
s/p DES that occluded diagnonal. Repeat cath unchanged. He was 
started on plavix, atorvastatin, ACE-I, and metoprolol. Echo 
showed LVEF 35-40% with hypokinesis of mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. He was started on warfarin for his hypokinetic LV as 
well as his atrial fibrillation as discussed below.

# ___
Possibly mixed cardiogenic/distributive given mixed venous O2 
65%, CI 2.1, PCWP 25. He initially required pressors and balloon 
pump and was then successfully weaned off both. He remained 
hemodynamically stable during rest of hospital course. 

# Atrial Fibrillation
Patient with a reported history of paroxysmal afib per his PCP 
for which he was maintained on digoxin as well as aspirin 325mg 
PO daily prior to admission.  He was found to be in atrial 
fibrillation during admission and the decision was made to 
anticoagulate with Coumadin.  He was continued on home dose 
digoxin.  His home dose aspirin was decreased as discussed above 
with initiation of Coumadin.

# Hematuria: 
Likely traumatic in setting of systemic anticoagulation, as 
patient pulled at ___. Cytology was negative. He will followup 
outpatient with urology.

# Dyspnea: 
Patient had acute episodes of dyspnea.  This was mainly 
attributed to pulmonary edema and improved with diruesis.  
Additionally, CXR showed possible consolidation of RUL, 
concerning for aspiration pneumonia. However, treatment was 
deferred as he had no other focal signs of infectious pna.  He 
did have sputum cultures which grew Klebsiella pneumonia but on 
discussion with ID, felt this did not warrant any treatment as 
he was asymptomatic.  He was discharged on po lasix 20 mg daily 
with next electrolytes to be checked ___. 
 
# C diff, severe: 
Had loose stool in setting of antibiotic tx for Hpylori 
(initiated outpatient). Given WBC >15, ___, age >___ treated as 
severe. Patient was started on vancomycin 125mg PO qid for 14 
day course (day ___, last day ___. 
 
# GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD): 
Endoscopy confirmed H Pylori treated with PPI + 
clarithromycin/amoxicillin since ___ for 14 days. Omeprazole 
was continued. Antibiotics held in setting of c.diff infection. 

# Delirium: 
Patient with frequent sundowning during hospitalization 
requiring Seroquel po.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# Spinal Stenosis: Continued gabapentin, d/ced naproxen.  Did 
not complain of pain throughout hospital course.  Explained he 
should not take any more NSAIDS in setting of recent ACS and now 
on Coumadin, Plavix and asa. 
# DM: maintained on ISS during admission and discharged on home 
glipizide and metformin
# HTN: Home dose metoprolol uptitrated.  Home dose lisinopril 
decreased.  Home dose imdur discontinued.
# HLD: Transitioned home dose simvastatin to atorvastatin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
- Discharge weight: 63.7kg 
- patient will require urology followup given hematuria during 
admission.  Urine cytology negative.
- patient will need to be treated for hpylori once he completes 
a course of PO Vancomycin for Severe CDiff
- Please check electrolytes on ___ on lasix
- Coumadin initiated given atrial fibrillation, ASA decreased 
from 325 mg to 81 mg daily
- Started on Plavix given recent stent placement, atorvastatin 
80 mg (stopped simvastatin), and Lasix 20 mg po daily
- Home metoprolol was increased from 25 mg XL to 50 mg XL daily, 
lisinopril decreased to 2.5 mg po daily and home imdur was 
discontinued
- patient will need to continue a 14 day course of PO Vanc (day 
___- ___ last day ___ for cdiff infection
- Patient instructed to not take any NSAIDS
- SLP treatment at rehab for pharyngeal strengthening exercises
