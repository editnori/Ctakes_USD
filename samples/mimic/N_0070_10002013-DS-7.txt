Pertinent Results:
Echocargiogram ___
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. 
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or 
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. 
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest. 
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity ___ were 
obtained from 2D images. Normal regional LV systolic function. 
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). 
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal descending 
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta. 
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. 
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. 
___ VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial 
TR. 
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. 
No PS. Physiologic PR. 
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. 
Conclusions  
Pre operative:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is a small PFO with a 
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There 
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Chest X-Ray ___ 
There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Bilateral pleural 
effusions are 
small.  Aside from atelectasis in the left lower lobe, the lungs 
are grossly clear.  Almost complete resolution of atelectasis in 
the left upper lobe.  Sternal wires are aligned.  Widened 
mediastinum has improved.  A small air-fluid level in the 
retrosternal region suggests the presence of a tiny pneumothorax 
and small effusion.  These are most likely located in the left 
side.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent Off pump coronary artery bypass graft x3, 
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery 
and saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, and obtuse marginal
arteries. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. She required 
Nitroglycerin for hypertension her first night post op but was 
transitioned to oral betablocker and diuretics. POD 1 found the 
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. 
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically 
stable. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for 
further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication. She was started on plavix due to being 
done off pump and will it need to be continued for six months. 
Blood sugars were closely monitored and she was restarted on her 
home regime which have slowly improved. The patient was 
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with 
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the 
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain 
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged 
home with visiting nurse services in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions.
