EKG:
Sinus rhythm at a rate of 69. Normal axis. The PR interval is 
prolonged at 204ms (slightly more than prior ekg). Q wave in 
III. Non-specific ST and T changes.

Nuclear Stress Test: 
INTERPRETATION:  
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast attenuation. There is activity adjacent to the heart in 
the rest and stress images. 
Left ventricular cavity size is increased. 
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, moderate 
reduction in photon counts involving the mid and basal 
inferolateral walls and the distal lateral wall. Gated images 
reveal normal wall motion.  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 52% with an 
EDV of 107 ml (reprocessed at workstation).  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Reversible, medium sized, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the LCx territory. 
2. Increased left ventricular cavity size with normal systolic 
function. 
Compared to the prior study of ___, the defect is new. 
.
Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 
demonstrated three-vessel coronary artery disease.  The ___ did 
not 
have angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD 
had 60% 
in-stent restenosis at the junction of the old Cypher stent 
placed in 
___ and the new Promus stent placed in ___ the D2 branch was 
jailed 
with 60% origin stenosis.  The LCx had a 50% stenosis at its 
origin; 
there was a 90% stenosis of the OM1 branch.  The mid-RCA had a 
50% 
stenosis. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial 
hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 142/74 mmHg. 
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of OM1 with a 3.0x15mm PROMUS 
stent 
which was postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography revealed no 
residual 
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III 
flow (see 
PTCA comments). 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the OM1 with a DES. 
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Unstable angina: Description of the pain was somewhat atypical 
for angina in that she experiences in when she lays down and it 
is also reproducible. However, given her history of CAD status 
post multiple PCIs and many risk factors, the patient underwent 
stress test to rule out CAD. Nuclear stress test showed a 
reversible, medium sized, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the left circumflex territory. In light of these 
stress test findings, the patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization. Prior to cardiac catheterization, she was 
prehydrated given her acute kidney injury. The patient had a 
drug-eluting stent placed to the obtuse marginal branch. The 
patient became acutely hypertensive during cardiac 
catheterization and was started on a nitroglycerin drip (see 
discussion below). The patient was weaned from this quickly. The 
patient was continued on aspirin (full-dose), plavix, 
metoprolol, and imdur. Her home dose of atorvastatin was 
increased given evidence of coronary artery disease. Serial 
cardiac enzymes were negative times 3.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Patient is to continue taking aspirin 
325mg and plavix 75mg daily for the next year. Patient will have 
cardiology follow-up as an outpatient with the ___ 
___ ___ group in ___. 
.  
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine currently 1.7, up from 1.4 in 
___. Renal function previously was normal. Upon admission, 
the patient's lisinopril and furosemide were discontinued. Of 
note, hte patient was started on furosemide approximately ___ 
months ago, which coincides with the development of the 
patient's elevated serum creatinine. Serum creatinine was 
trended through the admission and improved. The patient was 
restarted on her home lisinopril, though her serum creatinine 
was noticed to be increasing so was discontinued with 
instructions to restart this medication after follow-up with her 
primary care physician. The patient was instructed to have a 
basic metabolic panel drawn ___. 
.  
# Diastolic heart failure: Patient was euvolemic through her 
admission. Her home lasix was discontinued during this admission 
given her acute kidney injury. The patient will follow-up with 
her primary care physician regarding ___ of lasix. 
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Outpatient BMP for monitoring of serum 
creatinine and reinitiation of lasix by the primary care 
physician. 
.  
# Type 2 Diabetes Melltius, insulin dependent: Moderately 
controlled with last A1c 7.9% in ___. Lantus and sliding 
scale was continued through the hospitalization. She was 
discharged home on her home doses of lantus and her home insulin 
sliding scale.   
.
# Hypertension: Through most of the patient's admission, her 
blood pressure was  well controlled (goal <130/80). She was 
continued on metoprolol and imdur, though furosemide and 
lisinopril were discontinued in light of the patient's elevated 
serum creatinine. However, during the patient's cardiac 
catheterization, she was noted to have elevated systolic blood 
pressures and was started on a nitroglycerin drip for control of 
blood pressures. The patient was weaned from the nitroglycerin 
drip with in 4 hours after cardiac catheterization. The patient 
received a dose of lisinopril, but because of rising serum 
creatinine, the patient's next dose was held. 
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Follow-up with primary care physician 
regarding recent hospitalization and anti-hypertensive regimen 
in light of elevated serum creatinine.  
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Well controlled with last LDL 50 in ___ 
(goal LDL<70), though triglycerides mildly elevated.  
Atorvastatin was increased to 80mg daily given the new CAD 
lesions. Patient also had a fasting lipid panel that was drawn, 
which was pending at time of discharge.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Follow-up of pending fasting lipid panel.  

. 
# COPD: Currently asymptomatic. Patient was continue fluticasone 
and albuterol as needed.
