CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on Exertion
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a past medical
history pertinent for HFrEF (35% ___ CAD s/p CABG and
subsequent PCI, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right
ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on apixaban, stage III chronic
kidney disease (Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1), cerebrovascular disease,
and metastatic melanoma of unknown primary on checkpoint
inhibitor pembrolizumab who was found volume overloaded with
increased DOE, admitted to ___ for IV diuresis. 

Per most recent outpatient CHF notes:

He was seen by his primary car primary Cardiologist, Dr. ___ increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Dr. ___ 
a
___ and felt his LVEF was ~30% and reduced from prior. He was
started on low-dose Entresto, but couldn't tolerate it from a BP
prospective. He was previously on losartan which was stopped
due to this lightheadedness, dizziness and worsening renal
function. Dr. ___ concern about the possibility of
myocarditis secondary to the checkpoint inhibitor. When he
followed up with the Oncology team on ___, his symptoms were
somewhat improved. Cardiac biomarkers were notable for a rising
NTproBNP to >10K but normal CK-MB and minimally elevated 
troponin
T of 0.03, which is not unexpected in the setting
of decompensated ___ failure and chronic kidney disease. He 
was
planned to receive immunotherapy on ___, but treatment was
held due to elevated Cr. Recheck showed improvement. The patient
restarted pembrolizumab on ___. Pembrolizumab was again 
held
in ___ for diarrhea and elevated LFTs 

In addition, he also received intravenous hydration.
Subsequently, he was noted to be more volume overloaded, at 
which
time Torsemide from 20 mg daily to 30 mg daily then 40 mg daily.
Troponin testing showed Trop-T of 0.04, attributed to renal
insufficiency. The patient was also noted to have mild
hyperkalemia (K 5.7) for which potassium supplementation was
stopped and torsemide dose increased. He was also seen in the
Emergency room in the ___ ___ due to a
fall with resultant scalp laceration. CT head and neck was
unremarkable. 

He presented this morning ___ for his scheduled visit at
___ clinic where he noted that his weight had been 126 lbs most
recently on his home scale. He also reported decreased appetite
that he attributes to eating a different diet. He currently has 
a
___ care taker that makes ___ food for him, adhering
to a low sodium diet, that he does not like as much as his
regular diet. He drinks ___ glasses of water or juice daily. He
was taking torsemide 40 mg daily, that he decreased to 30 mg
daily several days ago as he felt he was urinating too
frequently. He also ran out of tamsulosin several days ago so
stopped taking this around the same time. He noted becoming 
short
of breath after taking 20 steps or less. Due to his volume
overloaded noted on exam he was recommended for admission to ___
for IV diuresis

On the floor, he endorses the above history. He noted that his
SOB has progressive gotten worse. Mostly occurs with activity.
None at rest. He noted that his weight has been slowly 
decreasing
due lack of appetite and him being to lazy. He has a home health
aid everyday from 11am-7pm, who helps him with ADL.  He endorses
abdominal bloading. 

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope,
or presyncope.

ROS otherwise negative, unless otherwise noted above

==================== 
PATIENT SUMMARY: 
==================== 
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with PMHx of CAD s/p 
CABG
and subsequent PCI, HFrEF (35% ___, moderate tricuspid
regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary
hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on apixaban,
stage III chronic kidney disease (Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1),
cerebrovascular disease, and metastatic melanoma of unknown
primary on checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab who was found
volume overloaded with increased DOE, admitted to acute ___ 
failure for IV diuresis, now transitioned to oral duiretics. 

# CORONARIES: Left Main and two vessel coronary disease (___).
# PUMP: 35% ___ 
# RHYTHM: Ectopic rhythm, PR prolongation, left axis deviation, 
RBBB

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
============== 
# ___ Failure with reduced ejection fraction
# Right ventricular dysfunction, TR, pulm HTN
# Volume overload
His ___ failure exacerbation is likely secondary to his recent
administration of IV fluids in addition to his self down
titration of his torsemide over the last week. In addition, he
does not follow a restricted fluid intake and drinks ___ glasses
of water or juice daily. Furthermore, he has not tolerated
guideline directed medical therapy due to recurrent issues with
acute kidney injury and elevated transaminitis while on
pembrolizumab therapy. He was clinically volume overloaded with
elevated BNP 16020. We initiated IV lasix 160 bolus and put him 
on a lasix gtt with good response, however he his Cr increased 
from 2.1-->2.7. His Cr. improved with transition to PO Torsemide 
40 mg daily. We monitored and aggressively repleted his 
potassium. No afterload reduction or neural hormonal blockade 
was added.

# Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline 2.1-2.3 . 
Cr 2.1 on admission(Stable )- Cr on discharge:2.2
Cr initially uptrended above baseline from 2.1---> 2.7. Felt 
likely due to increased diuretic usage as it improved with 
stopping diuretics. Less likely cardiorenal syndrome. In 
addition,patient was recently seen in follow-up by nephrology. 
They felt his CKD was less likely to be related to pembrolizumab 
and more likely related to age-related decline in renal 
function. Creatinine 2.2 on discharge (stable).

# Metastatic Melanoma 
He is followed by Dr. ___. He was previously on
Pembrolizumab which was held due diarrhea, elevated LFTs and
worsening kidney function. Negative troponin and CK MB, no 
concern
for drug-induced myocarditis at this point. Followup in 
___ clinic in 2weeks after discharge

# Elevated transaminiatis
Stable. Statin and ___ had previously been held. No changes made 
during admission. 

# Urinary frequency
Likely due to diuretic use. Afebrile and asx otherwise
-Continued home tamsulosin

# Coronary artery disease, s/p CABG and LAD PCI.
-Continued aspirin 81 mg daily
-Statin stopped prior to admission due to elevated LFTs. 
Continued holding. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
============== 

# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation
Rythym: Continue amiodarone 200mg for rhythm control strategy
(monitoring safety labs)
-Continued anticoagulation with apixaban 2.5mg twice daily

# Hypertension: Stable.
