CXR ___:
FINDINGS:
 
Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is persistent 
blunting of left costophrenic angle laterally suggestive of 
underlying scarring or pleural thickening.  The lungs are 
otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal 
limits.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again 
noted.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Exercise Stress ___:
IMPRESSION: Atypical sudden onset of chest tightness with 
non-specific ST segment changes to achieved low workload. 
Resting mild systolic hypertension with a blunted hemodynamic 
response to exercise. Echo report sent separately.

Exercise Echo ___:
IMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity. Non-specific ECG 
changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic evidence of 
inducible ischemia to achieved low workload. Resting mild 
systolic hypertension with a blunted hemodynamic response to 
physiologic stress.

chronic  angina, dCHF, HTN, DM who presents with chest pain 
concerning for crescendo angina.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
  
Chest pain: patient with high coronary risk, however recent cat 
6 months ago did not reveal interveneable disease.  Fact that 
she is having reproducability on physical exam suggests non 
cardiac cause, however symptoms are complicated by patient's 
history of cognitive impairment.  Given known CAD with 70% 
stenosis stress echo was performed to assess for functional 
abnormality with exertion.  No ECHO abnormalities were noted 
although pt reported atypical chest pain with stress.  She was 
continued on home ASA, plavix, statin, nitrate and metoprolol 
while in-house.  She was monitored on tele without any alarms.  
She was discharged home after a negative stress to follow-up 
with her PCP and ___.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
 
# Diastolic CHF (EF>50%): No signs of fluid overload currently.  
Not on baseline diuresis.  She was continued on home BB and ___ 
and monitored daily for signs of decompensation and required no 
diuresis.
 
# Diabetes:  HISS in-house, she was also continued on home 
insulin regimen with 80 lantus QHS

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___-

You came to the hospital with chest pain.  You had lab chests 
and EKG's that were reassuring that you were not having a heart 
attack.  While you were here, you had a stress test which did 
not suggest any evidence of worsening coronary artery disease.  
Your chest pain was reproducible with touching your chest, which 
is not typical of coronary artery disease pain.  This likely is 
related to musculoskeletal pain.  
Some changes have been made to your medication list.  Please 
followup with your cardiologist for further medication changes.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
