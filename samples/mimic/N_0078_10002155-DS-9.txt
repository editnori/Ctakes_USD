STUDIES:

Chest Xray ___: 
1. In setting of extensive bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and the 
absence of 
recent comparable studies, new pneumonia would be difficult to 
recognize in the right lower and middle lobes. 

CT Chest ___: 
1. Increased bronchial and peribronchial nodules with 
ground-glass halos 
since ___, predominating upper and middle lobes, most 
consistent with infection. 
2. Stable right lower lobe reticular opacities with areas of 
consolidation 
and widespread nodules predominantly involving the right upper 
and middle 
lobes, consistent with known bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma. 
3. Stable large left thyroid mass. 
4. Stable abdominal aortic intimal calcification displacement. 
5. Stable renal cysts. Miniscule nonobstructive right renal 
calculus. 
6. Moderate emphysema.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with stage IV lung adenoca, CAD who presented 
with fever at home.

#. Fever: She presented with ___ weeks of fatigue, nonproductive 
cough that is chronic, and 1 day of fevers.  Chest xray was 
unremarkable but could not rule out infection given the location 
of her lung cancer.  She had negative blood and urine cultures.  
She underwent CT chest on admission, as she was due for a repeat 
CT scan the following week routinely.  The CT chest was 
concerning for a new infectious process in the right upper and 
middle lobes, as well as stable areas of consolidation and 
nodules consistent with bronchioalveolar carcinoma.  She was 
started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin and was discharged on 
cefuroxime and azithromycin.  She was also discharged on home 
oxygen (she already used oxygen sometimes at home and was 
instructed to use it full-time after discharge).

#. Acute renal failure: She had an elevated creatinine on 
admission to 2.5 from a recent baseline of 1.3-1.8.  This was 
felt to be prerenal azotemia and it improved with IV hydration.  
However, she still has new renal insufficiency and would likely 
benefit from follow-up with nephrology after discharge.  She was 
also instructed to follow a low potassium diet.

#. Hyponatremia: She had low serum sodium on admission, felt to 
be related to hypovolemia in the setting of her illness.  Her 
sodium improved to normal levels with IV fluids.

#. Stage IV Lung Adenocarcinoma: She is s/p 6 cycles of 
pemetrexed.  She should follow-up with her primary oncologist 
for further treatment.

#. Anemia: She was given 1 unit of PRBCs for anemia on 
admission.  Her anemia was felt to be related to her recent 
chemotherapy.

#. CAD: She was continued on a statin, aspirin, and clopidogrel.

#. HTN: She was continued on amlodipine.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a fever.  You underwent 
a CT scan of your chest that showed that you likely have

wear supplemental oxygen at rate of 2 liters per minute.

You also had a low blood count and were given a blood 
transfusion.  It was felt that your blood count was low due to
