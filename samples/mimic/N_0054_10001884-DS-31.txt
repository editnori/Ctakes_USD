pain present with drop in HCT and progressive SOB. 

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
#GI Bleed: Presented to PCP with melena and wiping BRBPR. CBC 
was taken and Hgb found to drop from 11.3->8.8. Two large bore 
IVs were placed, started on IV PPI, and she was type and 
screened. Vitals remained stable, so patient was continued on 
home rivaroxaban. She was evaluated by GI who recommended upper 
GI endoscopy, which showed no evidence of bleeding. She remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout the admission. Hgb 9.1 on day 
of discharge. She was discharged home on both her Xarelto and 
ASA.

#SOB: Long standing history of smoking and COPD. Progressive 
exertional dyspnea despite use of Spiriva, advair, fluticasone 
nasal spray, theophylline, and albuterol nebulizers. Has 
increased rescue inhaler use.  Etiology unclear, does not appear 
to be infectious given chronicity. Most likely is progression of 
underlying COPD. PFT's were obtained while in-house. Smoking 
cessation was also discussed. Will need continued outpatient f/u 
re: her COPD.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
#Afib: Continued home amiodarone and diltiazem. Continued 
rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, as discussed above.

#HTN: Stable, continued on home diltiazem, Imdur, HCTZ

#Anxiety/insomnia: stable, continued home lorazepam QHS PRN for 
insomnia/anxiety.

#Dry eyes: History of glaucoma. Continued home latanoprost 
ophthalmic drops.

#PAD: Stable, continued on home atorvastatin, s/p iliac stent. 
OK to continue aspirin as well.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Should consider outpatient colonoscopy to potentially identify 
any source of lower GI Bleed.
- Given stable hemoglobin/hematocrit while inpatient as well as 
no evidence of bleeding on EGD, her Xarelto and Aspirin were 
continued on discharge
- Was treated with IV PPI while inpatient, but given no evidence 
of active bleeding, was discharged on home Ranitidine 300mg PO 
daily
- Continue to encourage smoking cessation
