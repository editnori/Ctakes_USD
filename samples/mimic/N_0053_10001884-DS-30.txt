Studies:
1. CXR ___: No acute cardiopulmonary process  
2. ___: Exercise stress test  
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old woman with a history of PAD and 
 
LBBB was referred to the lab from the ER following negative 
serial  
cardiac markers for evaluation of chest discomfort. The patient 
was  
referred for a dipyridamole stress test but due to her 
theophylline  
therapy we were not able to proceed. Due to her frequent atrial 
ectopy we chose not to give her dobutamine but had her walk on 
the treadmill instead. She exercised for 3 minutes of a modified 
___ protocol and stopped due to leg claudication. The 
estimated peak MET capacity was 2.5 which represents a poor 
functional capacity for her age. No arm, neck, back or chest 
discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study. The 
ST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the setting of 
the baseline LBBB. The rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated 
apbs, occasional atrial couplets and a 6 beat run of PSVT. Rare 
isolated vpbs were also noted. Resting mild systolic 
hypertension with a pprorpriate increase in BP with exercise and 
recovery.  
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or interpretable ST 
segments at a high cardiac demand and poor functional capacity. 
Nuclear report sent separately.  
3. ___ CATH:  
LMCA: short, no CAD. LAD: mild  
focal origin disease (20%) and mild proximal disease (30%). LCX: 
 
minimal luminal irregularities. RCA: 30%.  
4. ECG ___: sinus rhythm with multiple PACs, left axis 
deviation, old LBBB 
5. ECG ___: Likely atrial tachycardia. Left bundle-branch 
block. Compared to the previous tracing atrial tachycardia has 
replaced sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Left 
bundle-branch block was previously noted. 
6. ECHO ___: Conclusions  
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There 
is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular 
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic 
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
frequent atrial ectopy is seen; biventricular function appears 
similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course
===========================================================
___ PMH of CAD, PVD, and COPD presenting with recurrent 
non-exertional substernal chest pain. The patient has a history 
of mild CAD but labs were significant for negative troponins and 
EKG was without ischemic changes. During her admission, she also 
developed multiple episodes of atrial tachycardia (AFib vs. 
Aflutter) and was started on Amiodarone for rate/rhythm control 
and Rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, and kept on home dose of 
Diltiazem also for rate control. She did not have any episodes 
of chest pain during hospitalization, so was discharged once 
atrial fibrillation/flutter was controlled. She will need to 
follow up with her primary care doctor regarding vague chest 
pain which led to admission.

Acute Issues:
========================================================
#Atrial Tachycardia: During admission pt had runs of wide 
complex tachyarrythmia, thought likely supraventricular in 
origin: rapid Atrial Fibrillation/ Flutter vs. atrial 
tachycardia, with abberancy (complexes with similar morphology 
to native LBBB). She was treated with Diltiazem and Amiodarone 
and had fewer episodes of tachycardia. EP team evaluated patient 
and recommended anticoagulation and outpatient follow up to 
consider EP study and possible ablation of Atrial Flutter. 
Patient was discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor, Amiodarone 
200mg twice daily x 1 week followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. 
Diltiazem continued at home dose. Rivaroxaban added for 
anticoagulation. As per outpatient cardiologist (Dr. ___, 
plavix was discontinued in light of addition of Rivaroxaban and 
interest in avoiding triple therapy in this patient. Pt was 
given follow up appointments with Drs. ___. She was 
scheduled to see Dr. ___ EP evaluation in 2 months.

#Chest pain: Pt presented with substernal chest pain that 
occurred at rest and was ruled out for MI with no troponin 
elevation or significant new ECG changes. Likely her chest pain 
was related to periods of tachycardia, although while in the 
hospital the runs of atrial tachycardia did not reproduce chest 
pain. She did not have any episodes of chest pain during 
hospitalization, so was discharged once atrial 
fibrillation/flutter was controlled. She will need to follow up 
with her primary care doctor regarding vague chest pain which 
led to admission.

#Dry eyes: pt had erythema and pain of R eye, found to have dry 
eyes per optholmology. Sent out with Artificial tears and 
erythromycin eye drops. Patient had follow up appointment 
already scheduled with optholmology and was instructed to attend 
appointment.

Chronic Issues:
=============================================================
# COPD  Pt appeared to be at baseline respiratory status. She 
was sent home with her home albuterol neb, albuterol inhaler, 
Fluticasone nasal spray, fluticasone-salmeterol diskus, 
tiotropium bromide nebs, and theophylline

# PAD: 
As above, we stopped Clopidogrel as patient is now on 
Rivaroxaban and wanted to avoid triple therapy as per her 
cardiologist Dr. ___.

Transitional Issues:
==============================================================
1. Patient was discharged on Amiodarone 200 mg po twice daily 
for one week until ___ and then 200mg po daily thereafter 
until her EP appointment with Dr. ___ in approximately 2 months.
2. Pt was discharged on Rivaroxaban 20 mg qpm with dinner
3. Pt discharged with outpatient ___ of Hearts monitor with 
results to be interpreted by Cardiologist.
4. She presented with chest pain but did not have elevated 
biomarkers or EKG changes concerning for myocardial damage. 
Moreover, pt remained asymptomatic during periods of 
supraventricular tachycardia while she was hospitalized. Patient 
may benefit from outpatient stress test if such symptoms return.
5. On day of discharge, pt had significant R eye pain and 
redness, was evaluated by Optholmology, who felt that it was 
just dry eyes, treated with erythromycin drops and artifiical 
tears. Patient already has appt w/ Opthamology in 5 days which 
she will need to attend.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ due to concerning chest pain symptoms 
which we think are due to infrequent bursts of a rapid heart 
rate. Since the rapid rate makes you at increased risk for 
stroke, you were started on a blood thinning medication called 
Rivaroxaban which you will need to take every day. Our 
specialized cardiologists who deal specifically with the 
electrical rhythm of the heart evaluated you and felt that you 
would benefit from a medication called amiodarone which was also 
started. You will need to follow up with them in their clinic 
regarding this abnormal rhythm. In the meantime, you were 
outfitted with a Holter monitor to record your heart rate at 
home. It is very important that you follow up with Dr. ___ 
your cardiologist.

We wish you all the best,

Sincerely,
Your care team at ___
