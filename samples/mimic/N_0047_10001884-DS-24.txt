TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  9 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  83 
 
SYMPTOMS: ATYPICAL PEAK INTENSITY: ___ 
 
  
INTERPRETATION: ___ yo woman was referred to evaluate an atypical 

chest discomfort. The patient completed 9 minutes of a Gervino 
protocol 
representing a fair exercise tolerance for her age; ~ ___ METS. 
The 
exercise test was stopped at the patient's request secondary to 
fatigue. 
During exercise, the patient reported a non-progressive, 
isolated upper 
left-sided chest discomfort; ___. The area of discomfort was 
reportedly 
tender to palpation. This discomfort resolved with rest and was 
absent 
2.5 minutes post-exercise. In the presence of the LBBB, the ST 
segments 
are uninterpretable for ischemia. The rhythm was sinus with 
frequent 
isolated APDs and occasional atrial couplets and atrial 
triplets. 
Resting mild systolic hypertension with normal blood pressure 
response 
to exercise. The heart rate response to exercise was mildly 
blunted. 
  
IMPRESSION: Fair exercise tolerance. No anginal symptoms with 
uninterpretable ECG to achieved workload. Resting mild systolic 
hypertension with appropriate blood pressure response to 
exercise. 
Suboptimal study - target heart rate not achieved. 
 
SIGNED:  ___ 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ with several month history of left sided arm and chest 
wall pain in the setting of LBBB presenting for ___.  
.  
.  
# Chest Pain:The patient's symptoms were not typically anginal 
in nature to suggest ACS. However she does have several cardiac 
risk factors and a LBBB, so  physicians could  not r/oMI with 
EKG alone. Trop. results were negative x3. Stress Echo revealed 
new regional dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior and 
inferolateral walls consistent with single vessel disease in the 
PDA distribution. A cardiology consult was obtained and they 
felt she could be managed medically. Patient was already on an 
aspirin, and a statin. Given history to suggest asthma B-blocker 
was contraindicated. She was discharged on 120 mg extended 
release diltiazem with instructions to follow up in cardiology 
and with her PCP. 
.
# Supraventricular tachycardia: The patient had multiple runs of 
SVT that was likley MAT in the setting of severe obstructive 
lung disease and chronic theophylline use. Cardiology 
reccomended that we discontinue her theophylline. We spoke with 
her pulmonologist who agreed this would be the best course of 
action for her. She was discharged with instructions to 
discontinue use of theophylline and follow up with her 
pulmonologist and cardiology.
