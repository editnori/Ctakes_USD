IMAGING:

___ CXR:

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with history of COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation on 
apixaban, hypertension, CAD, hyperlipidemia, and recurrent 
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation over the last 4 months, 
who presented with dyspnea and increased wheezing secondary to 
severe COPD.
 
#Recurrent COPD exacerbation: Patient presented with increased 
dyspnea and diffuse wheezing, likely secondary to COPD 
exacerbation. She has a history of multiple recurrent COPD 
hospitalizations. According to Pulmonary, patient has severe 
COPD based on her obstructive deficits on PFTs as well as her 
severe symptoms even at rest, as well as her more frequent 
exacerbations and is likely approaching end-stage disease. We 
continued Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, standing nebulizers, and 
theophylline. Pulmonary recommended additional budesonide 
inhalers to allow reduction of PO prednisone dose. Prednisone 
dose was increased back to 40mg (where patient was better) with 
a plan for slow wean by 5mg every 2 weeks. Also, patient was 
started on chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation; 
after discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed to stop 
azithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT the 
week after discharge, with plan to restart azithromycin once Dr. 
___ is able to see the patient. Patient did not want to go to 
pulmonary rehab. She was seen by Palliative Care who recommended 
initiation of morphine liquid suspension as needed for shortness 
of breath.

# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 
from a baseline of 1.0. She likely had poor PO intake. 
Creatinine on discharge was 0.9.
 
CHRONIC ISSUES:  
==================  
# Anxiety/Insomnia: We continued home lorazepam.
 
# Atrial fibrillation: We continued diltiazem for rate control 
and apixaban for anticoagulation.  
 
# Hypertension: We continued home imdur, hydrochlorothiazide, 
and diltiazem.  
 
# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ showed no evidence of 
significant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ showed EF > 
55% and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. We 
continued home aspirin and atorvastatin.
 
# Anemia: We continued home iron supplements. 

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:*** 
- Continue Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, and theophylline 
- Make sure patient receives standing nebulizers 
- Added additional budesonide inhalers to allow reduction of PO 
prednisone dose 
- Start chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation. 
(Patient was started on azithromycin in the hospital and QTc on 
___ was 472 ms. ___ discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed 
to stop azithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT 
the week after discharge, with the plan to restart azithromycin 
once Dr. ___ is able to see the patient.)
- Would recommend audiology testing at some point while patient 
is on chronic azithromycin
- Continue supplemental oxygen for comfort
- Follow up with Dr. ___ discharge 
- Continue Bactrim PPX (1 tab SS daily) given extended courses 
of steroids 
- Patient was discharged on prednisone 40 mg with plan for taper 
by 5mg every 2 weeks:
 Prednisone 40 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end 
___
 Prednisone 35 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end 
___
 Prednisone 30 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end 
___
 etc...
