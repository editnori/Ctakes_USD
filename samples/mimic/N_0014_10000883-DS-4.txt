History of Present Illness:
HPI:  Mr. ___ is a ___ yo ___ freshman at ___ (___) c h/o depressed mood and anxiety symptoms
(panic) who was sent to ___ at recommendation of ___, his
therapist of 4 months at ___ for evaluation of 3 weeks of
worsening depression with anhedonia, social isolation &
withdrawal, escalating feelings of guilt, poor sleep secondary 
to
ruminations of guilt.  Patient is also having trouble
concentrating and going to his other classes because of his
depression and anxiety.  He has been eating fine and taking care
of himself w/r/t hygiene.  Mr. ___ reported that what seems
have caused his recent bout of anxiety is the culmination of
stress in a professional relationship with one of his teachers 
at
his program.  For reasons that are not completely clear, patient
was removed from a studio class with a particular instructor. 
Patient referred me to speak with ___ to explain the 
specifics,
but ___ was not available and patient felt too
overwhelmed to give me the story in detail--in fact had a panic
attack during our talk.  For the past weeks, since being removed
from the class, Mr. ___ has written letters, called (did 
not
leave messages) and emailed this instructor w/o getting any
response.  The lack of response has caused an escalating pattern
of guilt that Mr. ___ has been dealing with by cutting
himself with a knife (cut left wrist, no stitches).  Last night,
in the context of this guilt, not sleeping and having more
anxiety, Mr. ___ began feeling suicidal and developed a 
plan
to kill himself by cutting himself with a knife.  He decided 
that
the only way he could deal with his overwhelming feelings would
be suicide.  Mr. ___ told his counselor about these 
thoughts
and his counselor recommended that he come to the ED.  

Mr. ___ reported that he has felt "highs," but never for
more than a day and never impacting sleep or resulting in
dramatically impaired decision-making (e.g., spending too much,
indiscriminate sexual relationships, etc).  Mr. ___ has no
h/o ___ psychotic symptoms, although his level of guilt has
reached a near psychotic proportion.  Mr. ___ denied ever
being asked by the instructor never to contact him, but he feels
the instructor not answering his calls or responding to emails
means that the instructor does not like him.  He denied any
thoughts of trying to harm the instructor.  

Mr. ___ reported feeling anxious a great deal, having a 
rare
panic attack.

diagnosis
of panic d/o).  Has been seeing a counselor ___ at ___ x 4
months.  Prior to 3 weeks ago, no h/o self-injurious behaviors,
although has had suicidal ideation in the past (once or twice
prior to last night, but never with intent like now).  Saw a
counselor in high school to help with "coping" with feeling
different in school.

Mr. ___ reported that he had thoughts of fighting with a
fellow student a few months ago, which is why he started in

situation). He said that ultimately he was able to come to terms
