Micro:

-Midline tip - NGTD
-C. diff PCR - neg

Imaging:

___: CXR: IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change with 
bilateral pleural effusions with right pigtail catheter in the 
lower chest.  Possible small right apical pneumothorax. 

___: CT-A IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the left, 
decreased 
since the most recent prior examination and trace on the right, 
markedly 
decreased compared to ___ with pigtail catheter noted 
in place on the right.   
3.  Ascites. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman, recently hospitalized for C. Difficile sepsis 
and shock, re-admitted to ___ from ___ with altered 
mental status, tachypnea and a mild respiratory acidosis.

#Hypoxia/hypercarbia: She initially required BiPAP and was 
admitted to the MICU for monitoring of her respiratory status.  
She was able to be weaned from BiPAP on ICU day 2 and remained 
on 2L NC at the time of discharge.  Cause of her respiratory 
symptoms is unclear, but may be due to hypoventilation from 
somnolence related to oversedation with Zyprexa.  Zyprexa was 
held at the time of discharge.  CTA Chest was negative for PE 
and showed no clear evidence of pneumonia.  She was initially 
started on HCAP antibiotics with vanc/cefepime which were 
stopped on HD 4 prior to discharge given that all cultures were 
negative and there was no consolidation on imaging. 

# Delirium: Likely multifactorial, but thought to be related to 
oversedation from Zyprexa.  There was no evidence of infection 
and antibiotics were quickly stopped as described above.  UA was 
dirty, but UCx was negative x2 (grew only yeast) and she had no 
urinary symptoms.  Most of her mental status changes were 
probably related to her sedationg medications and hypercarbia at 
admission, which improved with BiPAP and holding her 
antipsychotics.

# C Diff Colitis: Recently admitted for C. diff colitis with 
sepsis. Repeat C Diff PCR was negative during this 
hospitalization. She continued to have high volume stool output 
and Flexiseal is in place for skin ulceration.  ID was curbsided 
regarding vanco course given that she received a few days of 
HCAP antibotics and her PO vanco was changed to 125mg q6h for 7 
days after stopping IV vanc/cefepime (D7 will be ___.  
Flexiseal in place at discharge.

# Anemia: Patient with guaiac positive stools this admission, 
new from past admission.  Felt to be secondary to sloughing and 
mucosal oozing secondary to C diff. Normal lactate on admission 
and benign abdominal exam.  Hct has been variable recently, but 
fairly stable, although still markedly below her baseline of low 
to mid ___.

# Bilateral pleural effusions: Noted to have bilateral pleural 
effusions last hospitalization in setting of massive fluid 
resuscitation, right pleural pigtail catheter removed this 
admission in the MICU. She is still volume overloaded on exam, 
but her bicarb remained elevated, and she was not given any 
further diuresis.  The elevated bicarb is also be partially due 
to compensation from her respiratory acidosis.

# Volume overload: She has some diastolic dysfunction and has 2+ 
MR on ___. She continues to appear total body overloaded, likely 
in setting of volume resuscitation on prior admission for 
sepsis, but with contraction alkalosis currently, so further 
diuresis was held as above.  Consider further diuresis once 
hypercarbia improves and bicarb trends down.  

# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily 
 
# Hypertension: Patient was previously on lisinopril which was 
held since last admission in setting of sepsis and relative 
hypotension.  She remained normotensive

# GERD: Patient previously on omeprazole last hospitalization, 
which was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was 
transitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis but this was 
stopped again when she became delirious last hospitalization.  
She remains off H2 blocker at discharge because of concern that 
it may be contributing to her AMS.

# Code status this admission: FULL

# Transitional issues:
-Foley was removed ___ and she has not voided as of discharge, 
may need Foley replaced if she is unable to void
-Would restart diuresis when bicarb trends down
-Continue PO vanco 125mg q6h through ___
-Please follow Hct daily given melanotic stools, should resolve 
as her C. diff resolves
-Midline removed ___
-Pigtail catheter removed this admission
-F/u pending BCx, catheter tip cx
