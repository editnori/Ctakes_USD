Imaging:

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  Mild perihilar prominence, suspected to represent 
mildly prominent pulmonary vessels without definite pneumonia.  
Streaky left basilar opacification seen only on the frontal view 
is probably due to minor atelectasis or scarring. 
.  
CT A/P ___: 
1.  No acute intra-abdominal pathology. There is diverticulosis 
and sequelae of prior inflammation, but no active 
diverticulitis. 
2.  3-mm nodule seen along the right major fissure and right 
lower lobe.  According to ___ guidelines, in the absence 
of risk factors, no further followup is needed.  If patient has 
risk factors such as smoking, followup chest CT at 12 months is 
recommended to document stability. 

CXR ___:
There are low lung volumes with an appearance of bronchovascular 
crowding.  Despite this, there is likely mild vascular 
congestion and edema.  No focal consolidation is seen with 
linear bibasilar atelectasis.  The heart is top normal in size 
with aortic totuosity.  
  
IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema

Epi-___ with diabetes, morbid obesity, s/p MI, HTN who presents with 
2 days of fevers and cough productive of rust colored sputum 
with associated SOB.  
.  
# Fevers: Likely secondary to pneumonia, but possibly a viral 
illness. Most likely not bacterial process but no leukocytosis, 
just PMN predominance. Urine legionella neg. CXR underwhelming 
for pnuemonia but given poor PO intake and overall constellation 
of symptoms without other localizing source and neg CT, so 
patient was treated presumptively for CAP.  O2 sats stable on 
room air during the day, but at night de-satted.  On exam, lungs 
with improved wheezing since yesterday. With ambulation, O2 87, 
on ___, repeat cxr with pulm edema likely due to IV fluid bolus 
day prior. She was given lasix 40mg POx1.  On day of d/c, sats 
mid ___ on RA, down to 88% with prolonged ambulation.  Pt not 
subjectively SOB, likely this is baseline given pt's habitus.  
Treated with albuterol nebs and Levofloxacin 750mg PO daily.  On 
d/c, will complete 5 day course of levofloxacin.  
.  
# Hypotnatremia: Na 134 on am of discharge, improved from lowest 
of 129 .  Based on urine lytes/osm and serum osm, most likely 
SIADH secondary to pulmonary process.
.
# Diabetes: Stable.  Continued home Lantus 100U qhs and ISS.  
Held metformin in house.  Was on diabetic diet.  
.  
# HTN: Continued home lisinopril, metoprolol.  Held lasix 
initially in setting of dehydration initially.  Re-started on 
d/c.  
.  
# CAD: No CP now, ECG shows <1mm STD laterally, c/w prior. 
Continued home asa, metoprolol. Heart healthy diet. 
.  
# HL: Stable.  Continued home simvastatin pending med rec given 
80mg.  
.  
# Anxiety: Stable.  Continued home lorazepam, escitalopram.  
.  
# Anemia: Hct now at baseline 35.

follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for a pneumonia.  You were 
started on antibiotics which you will need to continue for one 
more day (as listed below).  You were also a little bit 
dehydrated when you came in, so you received some IV fluids to 
help hydrate you. 

You sodium levels in your blood were a bit low.  This was most 
likely due to the infection in your lungs.  As we treated your 
pneumonia, your sodium levels improved.

The following changes were made to your medications: 
- Please START levofloxacin 750mg daily for 1 more day

If you begin to feel more short of breath or more sick, please 
don't hesitate to call your primary care physician.
