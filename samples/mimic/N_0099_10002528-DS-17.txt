EEG ___:
==============
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. 
The background showed normal waking and sleep patterns. There 
were no focal abnormalities, epileptiform features, or 
electrographic seizures. A bradycardia was noted. 

IMAGING:
========
MRI BRAIN WITH/WITHOUT CONTRAST ___

FINDINGS:  
  
A 5 mm FLAIR hypointense and T1 isointense lesion at midline 
between the 
anterior and posterior pituitary is noted. There is no evidence 
of 
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, midline shift or infarction. The 
ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. 
There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
A 5 mm FLAIR hypointense and T1 isointense lesion at midline 
between the 
anterior and posterior pituitary likely represents a Rathke's 
cleft cyst.  
Further evaluation is needed, dedicated pituitary MR may be 
obtained.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

You were in the hospital because of headache, lethargy, and 
weakness after an iron infusion.

You had a number of tests performed in the hospital, all of 
which were reassuring. An MRI of your brain showed no evidence 
of stroke or inflammation. An EEG to monitor your brain waves 
showed no evidence of seizure. Your weakness gradually improved 
over the course of your hospitalization and will continue to 
improve after you leave the hospital. 

After leaving the hospital, you should continue to work on 
improving your strength. It will improve as long as you work 
hard!

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Care Team
