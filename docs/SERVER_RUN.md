Server Run Guide

Overview
- This bundle runs cTAKES 6 pipelines (WSD + Temporal + Coref + Smoking) at scale.
- Use scripts/run_compare_cluster.sh to process large corpora in parallel with the same pipelines as scripts/run_compare_smoke.sh.

Prereqs
- Java 11+ on PATH
- Linux server with fast local disk and /dev/shm available (for HSQL DB)

Quick Start
1) Unpack: tar -xzf ctakes-bundle.tgz && cd CtakesBun
2) Run all pipelines across a root with note-type subfolders (e.g., /data/SD5000_1):
   bash scripts/run_compare_cluster.sh \
     -i /data/SD5000_1 \
     -o /data/ctakes_out \
     -n 128 -m 8192 -t 4 --reports

   -i: input root (script treats each immediate subdir with .txt files as a group)
   -o: output base dir
   -n: parallel runners (processes) per pipeline
   -m: heap per runner in MB
   -t: Piper threads per runner
   --reports: build short Excel-XML summary per pipeline/group + top-level summary

Tuning for big servers (256 CPUs, ~2TB RAM)
- Start conservative, avoid oversubscription:
  -n 128 -t 4 -m 8192   # â‰ˆ 1TB heap across runners, balanced CPU utilization
  If CPU is underutilized and RAM is free:
  -n 160 -t 4 -m 8192   # or increase -t to 6 on fewer runners

Per-note-type runs (keep outputs separated)
for d in EmergencyDepartmentNote InpatientNote OutpatientNote RadiologyReport AdmissionNote DischargeSummary; do
  bash scripts/run_compare_cluster.sh -i "/data/SD5000_1/$d" -o "/data/ctakes_out/$d" -n 128 -m 8192 -t 4 --reports
done

Notes
- No UMLS API key required; the dictionary uses offline HSQL DB copied to /dev/shm per runner.
- After each pipeline/group completes, outputs are consolidated from shard_* into top-level folders (xmi, bsv_table, csv_table, html_table, cui_list, cui_count). Use --no-consolidate to skip, or --keep-shards to preserve shard_* after consolidation.
- Reports use short names to avoid Windows path length issues and are built after consolidation when enabled.
- For reporting and metrics, the runner saves a parent-level combined log and pipeline file:
  - <run_parent>/run.log: concatenation of all shard_*/run.log
  - <run_parent>/<pipeline>.piper: the tuned piper used by shards
  This ensures the Excel report can compute processing metrics even if shard_* folders are removed.
- All paths are relative to ./apache-ctakes-6.0.0-bin/apache-ctakes-6.0.0 unless CTAKES_HOME is set.
